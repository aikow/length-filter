You're not to blame.
What about Sam?
- I'll be dead.
Um, and, I'm hoping somebody saw something, 'cause most of the time, it's the only way we solve these cases, so...
I know it sounds daring, but if my books could make someone enjoy novels, that would make me happy.

I was a virgin.
What? The CIA should have shared that immediately.
You wanted to see me?
Sometimes he gets work off down the country.
Of course. Then they'll chopper him to Aga Khan hospital, in Mombasa.

You can't slow walk this to me six hours later, bro.
- He needed my help.
But if we can get whatever Peter Theo has on them...
Sir, body of a young woman's just been found on the beach of the Malbonne estate.
We felt he'd be more help to us out on the street.

Piper asked me to go and I had to say yes.
That got me through.
I'm here to do it for you.
You supply that, too?
-Keep it a secret.
- [Abby] Oh, my God, remember Andy?
She needs to hear this.
I mean, he sounded innocent enough, and since I just graduated med school, maybe I knew someone who'd want the job, but I can't help thinking that he's got some kind of agenda.
Mexican drug cartel.
You know, George, chopping wood is an art form.
Your plan failed.
I am good.
Alex, we were wrong.
Cos there's an "unrealistic prospect of conviction". His DNA's all over your knickers... Jim!

And guess who builds those prisons.
I, uh, don't think it's working.
I thought you were going to camp.

- What if it doesn't work? - Then we get crushed to death.
I also came here because we have a common acquaintance.
My bosses, they've been very patient.

So sad and needy.
When you find the hammer, there'll be a nick in the face.
Both peacefully asleep and safe, with no idea of what's to come.

You second this?
Because they know they'll never be as good as they were then.
You guys are the best.

These guys don't pay any attention to humans.
I got to where I wanted to be.
After what my father did, I told you I wasn't sure if it was okay if I wrote.
How much for this? £19,000 here.
Got a visitor.
She likes the threads. You ever think she lingered on Gosling?
I'll kill you in half a heartbeat. Always gotta be the hero, huh?
We're best friends.
Jon Jeffries, Omaha Pension.
Extremely well, thanks to my little helpers.
I want everyone to listen to exactly what she has to say.
"Who is Brother Bob?"
Uh, three years.
What's going on?
I mean, you can't do better than that.
She showed me the engagement ring that Trevor bought her.
Where are you going?
Not gone-gone, but I need him put away.
So, which direction were they going?
- So what now?
Hey, excuse me for a second.
Nah, destroying people's lives isn't smart.
-"? I'm just looking for something helpful.
They choose to take something bad and turn it into something good.
And now they can. Use this against us at any time, Force us do whatever they want.
- Okay, almost. - Yeah.
Mike, um, what we... shared on election night was...
Just because he helps me out doesn't automatically mean that I'm spoiled.
- Oh, is that all?
Your counsel means a lot to me.
I will see you at the Brooklyn Housing Authority then. Okay.
And that's him.
Wish we could all have dinner, but we're off to Savannah.
Just trust me on this one.
Teenage brains don't work the way adult brains work.
I gotta hand one thing to you, Craig. You are an equal opportunity hater.
Now I see why it's so urgent.
And to do that, we have to understand him.
What? I heard you got kicked out, and everybody has a theory.
Guess I'm not the only one having a rough day.
I'll make it now.
I mean, it, um...
Look, it's not your fault that you have a trust fund.
Did you ever doubt your husband?
Well, let's say you have book smarts.
Well, I'm actually glad that you asked that, Admiral, because our research says that 11,000 full and part-time jobs will be created, both civilian and military.
This is from Becca Reed.
Better than the bad guys.
He's not even fighting for the same cause that I'm fighting for.
Now you'll have to negotiate with me.
How-How about waiting for backup?
Dr. Choi, April, you're up.
I don't care.
Look, I'd love to get into that later, but let me just cut to the Chase Manhattan.
Then we started rolling from there.
Okay, wait, what?
Big daft grins.
Russian sleeper agent.
They're weaker than they've been in a long time.
You did a fantastic job. Really superlative.
So, can I take over the bar?
I'm going to dig a hole.
And I'm not trying to bully you with this.
Fathers at deliveries.
And you're telling us because... you think we're just gonna run in to that bunker and help you?
Put the guns down!
Well, it's everyone's supper, Charlie.
So what's the problem?
This isn't about Holly now, is it?
Jealously guarding its hidden treasures.
You know what?
Men will never willingly bow to the weaker sex.

I had a talk to the Queen about it at Balmoral.
Or her partner.
Look, you're right. Isler's a pain in the ass.
- Stop resisting then it won't hurt.
Let's go and take a look at that crime scene.
So that's how Dr. Katz performed his miracles.
No, no, no... .
Why can't you just listen?
She was Cathy's friend.
How did it go with Pin?
Kill them all.
Did he shoot at you?
Tall as me.
I mean, a guy can dream, right?
- Got it?
You've always felt it, haven't you?
Look, Cathy, your testimony's gonna seem petty and vengeful.
She parked at the side of a bush track and she buried Helen's body in a shallow grave.
Put yourself in my shoes.
If you want more, I can ask Felix.
Why are there certain...
He's not who he says he is.
He killed him.
Aw, good boy.
It's been five years since then... so you must be 31.
Previously on "Quantico"...
Ooh, look at that.
So if it's not too much trouble, I would like to resume our sessions, please.
Remember our one rule.
Okay, I have some right here, actually.
- Because I really need to know.
My best effort, when my arms were still fresh, created a blood spatter which reached 14.3 feet.
As opposed to zero if you lose.
How'd it go today?
- How can you be sure?
It was getting pretty bleak there. Don't...
- Just you and me.
Because if it were up to me, I would've fired her on the spot.
Adam hated that.
Ma'am, here is that napkin you asked for.
How you going?
I can even remember adults in my own family talking of how terrible those girls were for saying that.
Well, you don't wash your hands anyway.
A true genius doesn't go by the norms at first.
You're concerned about your wife.
- Hey. - Everybody's smartphones in their cars?
[hushes] Calm down, Maria!
If this is a trick, I'm going to kill all of us.
I mean, I'm bending over backwards for this kid.
Man, you better get your ass over there.
You really are an idiot.
My mom's kind of crazy.
Wait, okay, show me Raven again.
Fell getting out of bed.
So lovingly knit for him by his mother.
You hurt me!
Look at him. Just look at him.
- That's her surname.
I guess they'll look into that, too.
Safe to assume the shooters were also gang affiliated?
Ukhov is still gonna connect that he got attacked just a few hours after an off-duty cop accused him of murder.
Why are you so dead set on me not coming with you?
It's not like they're suddenly gonna confess.
When do we want we want them?
I don't think the baby I buried is the same as the baby I gave birth to.
It's like looking in a mirror.
Right, let's get you connected.
I am. Everybody all right?
- How many are there?
Did you get word to anyone on the outside that she thought that the real killer was still walking around free?
This is my neighborhood hideout spot.
- You said you were ready for this.
Uh, by which Becky means, she didn't know you were asking, doofus.
Either one could have vital information on Javier.
And how many have you successfully completed?
Is it a big story?
Spit right there.
He asked me what was my name and could he look at me.
You said we'd be an hour tops.
You play? No.
And you may, in fact, be one of them.
After Japan, what then?
Thank you. 'Cause I'm here right now.
Sorry, just seemed like the jig was up.
Build a Trojan horse and follow Pin inside it?
Enough hiding, I say we take the fight to them.
Oh, well done! I'm going to go and get a jar.
In the novels that I write, nobody dies.
Now you find whoever set that fire, and I want him alone.
In your own house, with Nash and Joshy.
Get your hands off the keyboard!
This is your chance to tell it your way.
A firing squad? No, no, no.
My mom has banned me from riding.
- That's horrible.
That's a nice spin, I guess.
What are you going to do to me?
That makes two of us.
Yeah. in 1969, a nun at Archbishop Keough was murdered.
No, you're right, it's the only explanation as to why I wouldn't know what I just saw, which was Harvey and Alex, arm in arm, laughing at me!
- Right here.
It's cooler that way.
Not surprising, but there's over a hundred Sam Parkers in 32 different states, including Alaska.
Tell me about it.
Snakes don't just gulp their prey.
I'm not going anywhere.

Supergirl created a little Kryptonian chaos as she made a super mess of the school's Hero Ball arena.

During the original plea process.

- I can't.
You couldn't hold a tune.
Go long, Wonder Woman.
- Do you clearly understand the nature of second-degree murder charges and that if you plead guilty, you are, from this point forward, waiving your right to a trial?
So you see, it's vital Mr. Kindler be held for treatment.
This doesn't excuse what you've done.
We just found him.
Girls, I've got an idea.
I mean, Eclipso, impending doom.
One Coke, please.
You look like a Harvey Wallbanger kind of girl.
Although saying no looks like you are favouring the opposition.
I don't know what's behind door number one, but I'm pretty sure it's not a Sea-Doo.

First and last.
Can you imagine me living here?
You seen Kirsten yet?
No, no. I-I-I can't leave Ralph. I didn't line up a sitter.
- They told me to rat on my people.
My life would have been very different if I had not gone in that confessional.
We can't keep running, can we, Lola?
She's being held captive.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
You're not coming?
Oh, God. You should write detective fiction!
Remember when you first came to storybrooke?
The order came from above.
Now, let's go back to unpacking.
No, I accidentally sent that out to my entire address book.
We're gonna follow him.
It was addictive.
Firefly was an easy target.
It was complicated.
- Now, now, Jake.
You mean, was he cheating on me?
Different than the author that I really love.
When did he tell you that, Jane?
I don't know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.
GMP has known that they have a problem with on-street grooming since 2005, at least.
Because I don't care to be represented by a man who questions my integrity.

I know I should have listened to you, and I know I didn't.
When I read her will, I realized something.
- By who? Someone who needs to speak with you immediately. Ryan.
Nice to meet you.

- You good?
I came as fast as I could.
They found Helen's phone in Sassafras last night.
You know they're only messing with you 'cause they can tell it gets to you, right?
As we speak.
What you're telling me is you're still afraid of him.
You should all try this too.
Oh, good God, I can't do this for another 20 years.
It seems the three of you have become a danger to my master plan.
Sorry about that little intrusion earlier.
Your situation or mine.
Don't make me regret it.
I called St. Joe's.
Hey. So an undercover unit tailed Lee Campbell to a military credit union in Pearl City.

They were walking in and out of people, weaving through crowds.
You ain't ever seen a wagon train long as this, Eli...
In his will, he left this message for me.
I don't know.
And I've never killed a fairy.
They all thought they could open me up and find some little kid shitting himself in the dark. No.
You do whatever you can for money.
Look, I'm a pedophile, okay?
Wow factor: ten out of ten.

Don't you worry, Cheryl.
I'll be opening this at home.
I want to know who delivered that video when it was delivered, and if it's real!
He got a little too drunk to make his way home.
Obviously, I've got to ask you some questions about what they actually did to you during the sex, OK?
He'll have friends at the port.

- Because I can't--
I heard that song.
Probably a couple weeks later, the same priest, Magnus, walked up to me in the hall... and he said he wanted to see me in his office.

Doctors are running some tests, so I figured I'd give them some space.
Everything above the red line that you see there is actually material that used to be buried that has been flipped up on end, and is now... or flipped upside-down, and is now laying as a pile of broken-up material.
I like the smell of smoke.
Yeah, I did.
- She needs to realise that.
We're still recovering from Katrina. Now, this will help New Orleans.
You go on.
My name is Carmen Zelaya.
Do you think Pride put his badge and gun on the body intentionally?
Sweetheart, why do you always think...?
He was gonna tell how the Navy lied to cover up the operation.
And now he's gonna work here.
I get it.
If she took 'em, that'll link her to the crime scene.
Are you seriously gonna sit there and tell me you didn't overstep?
You're a pointless fucking bitch. Do you know that?
We know the Council suspected a mole in their ranks.
I wish to God I had.
Yeah, I am looking out for you.
I need to see what I can do here. But okay.
- Please don't tell my mom.
Are you being sarcastic? Oh, no.
Not if we skip off it, like a rock.
Okay, come on, George.
Somewhere he knows well, and it's adjacent to a body of water if he were inclined to dispose of a corpse.
I killed him!
Until I find a new home, I'll stay at a hotel or something.
Last seen at his home at 4401 Burke.
'Ey, you! You little shit. That's my catchphrase, that.
They said I killed a woman named Alice White.
There's no defensive wounds, and from the looks of it, she hit her forehead on the bed frame going down.
I'm so sorry, Güero.
At least I was never married to Happy.
Wise beyond your years.
- [Katie] I know!
Yeah, eight years in a row.
- All right, see you.
Can we have a word?
There are people who can say,
You see that piece in the news?
It's in Washington, D.C.
Home with my husband all night.
- If that were true, deary, we wouldn't be having this conversation, would we?
Why do you think he'll kill again?
No matter what you're doing No matter what you're playing
Is it possible that any of the people he was harassing might've been angry enough to... No.
What do you mean?
Wasn't easy getting Jiya out of there, but no, we're all right.
To thank him and to keep his mouth shut, I paid him ten million yen.
Let's get that ventilation in there right now!
That's why everyone in space speaks English.
All right, Rip.
I was living with roommates, paying off student loans.
It's what they do.
It's fine by me.
I'm here to bail you out.
That'll just freak him out.
Mia's holiday project is going well.
So... please just let me help you get your life back.
Oh. Honestly, if I don't find something to do, I'm gonna wind up in a ditch. [chuckles]
How about some cream?
Then who's in his bedroom?
But... yes, it has been a difficult couple of days... for everyone.
They-they mentioned that, and they also... weren't they talking about how proud they were
- I-I got him.
I mean, I don't even know who recorded the thing.
Eh, maybe she'll change her mind.
Cooper tried to shut it down.
- I won't be long.
I'm Carmine, the window-washer guy.
Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.
Let's just hope he doesn't find us first.
Hey, hey, hey, are you ok?
- He does need to know, Jake...
As a matter of fact, we just were.
"It's for her."
50 grand was probably stolen.
And look at the walls... the whole place needs a paint job.
What... what happened?
- Think of the party, Congressman.
May I have the pleasure of a dance?
[Teefey] I feel like parents being honest and not ignoring issues and not ignoring what they went through will really help kids, I think, be a little bit more comfortable.
Each of these will carry ten kilos.
It's very late in the day.
And then he let her kill him?
You promised me!
It's possible one of the prisoners has stolen it.
I just can't believe Nanaka has been murdered.
It was a barrier to entry to keep the riffraff out.
Started drinking, doing drugs, acting crazy.
I heard that after her mother's death, she had no other relatives.
It was Magnus in this confessional.
- Mac, I saw him!

Because you know you would be dead without me.

What are you...
Nemo. I wanted to say goodbye.

Katie was killed, and Jack murdered the unsub in front of me.

Overdosed under the Long Beach pier on some cocktail of drugs you sold her.
I mean, I saw you in the elevator that day.
Listen to me.
You are inserting something.
Thank you, I'd appreciate that.
Do you know how much revenue that is gonna cost?
You're bad. You are a bad person.
I'm getting out.
- Stay away from Liz.
Crooked press attacks me.
Oh, Cyndi. Cyndi, pick me.
Literally there was a shit in the hallway last week.
Have a nice trip, then.
Well, it's just... he rented a car from here a couple of days ago, and I haven't heard a peep out of him.
Along with the e-mails I wrote between Felix and Sasha that I put on her computer.
This is nice.
Give me some.
Maybe it's the showroom poltergeist?
He just needs a little something to look at to get him started.
But somebody, somewhere did this to you.
We're here to help.
It's in writing.
Now, you had one job, Colonel, and you failed miserably.
If you're still worried about your speech, I'm happy to sing your praises, if you prefer.
Because I found out who she really is.
Did you mean to tell me you can understand people's feelings?
Harvey and I go mudding together all the time.
Is there anyone you can talk to?
She doesn't know the dangers.
Way I hear it, man in charge on the case is wild as a peach orchard hog.
It was a friend of a friend who was approached, and they reached out to me to see if I know anyone.
- So I...
You've turned down a lawyer, and you're pleading guilty to a murder you can't explain.
All that matters is ending the fighting.
OK, got to go, go, go.
Wow. I mean, I never liked the guy, but yeesh.
Maybe it's time to broaden your circle.
Most newer buildings don't even have ledges.
You're the real brains in your family.
He's sitting up in bed talking, laughing.
No, no, no. I'll get it, Lieutenant.
It's important at this stage that you don't allow the solution to boil dry or to start spitting.
'Cause it's fuckin' futile!
- Everybody stand back!
You know how she says she went to Saint Amelia's?
I'm a cop.
This water smells like turnips.
And selling to the highest bidder.
The victim is Elijah Hendricks. He's 25.
We would not have been able to do this without you.
For a while.
What are you doing in here?
Leighton Thomas, Petrie, Marr.
He didn't do this.
I just want you to take it away.
We'll be in trouble when we get back.
If he's live streaming news, I don't want him seeing any of this. Copy that.
No, I know.
Let them do their jobs.
- Yes, sir.
And once you cross that line, you can't ever go back.
Ryan, please, you have to believe me.
Yeah, well, you know, there's more to the spirit.
I don't know what I was thinking. I just...
Do you understand what you've come to talk to me about today? Yeah.
There's no proof of anything Morrison did.
That a name I'm supposed to know?
He had all the Cubs cards signed by the World Series team.
- Oh, Renata, Ashley's waking up.
You don't need to get a lawyer.
I loved my teachers, I loved my friends.
What do you think you're doing?
Well, judging from the massive head trauma and the hemorrhaging from the ears, nose and mouth there's no doubt Campbell died from the impact of the fall.
- I'm all right, thanks.
But I am her mother.
I'm starting to lose hope, bud.
I don't think being in the field is the best for me.
- I know it was a stupid thing to do, I'm not...
Did you know?
You've seen how this goes.
Get your hands off me! Get off me!
When was this?
Then that means... Zoe's on the team.
No, and if we're being honest right now, I don't think this thing with you and Rachel is, is a healthy thing.
- I've never even seen one!
How do you know?
Sometimes, but it's not what you're suggesting.
Call me a radical feminist sceptic.
Well, you hired me to, you know, do a different kind of wrestling show.
- My leg.
There was talk before Von Hauser, rumors that you were under siege.
Park him in the hallway over there. "We're gonna ride this whirlwind"? Keep telling me that.
We spent maybe 45 minutes to an hour listening to Russell.
I thought my life was over when you left.
That was Bea, and, uh... she was a really... she was a really good friend of mine, and, uh...
Well, that escalated quickly.
I thought you were being deployed.
It really pisses me off to think she would be killed for that.
A little bit.
Um, in what way?
It's got to be a record.
She means she'll find him and get all the glory.
Well, Siobhan knew what she was getting into, Felix.
Well, because he's my Uncle Jamie.
That's the end of... bye.
She says I'm stupid.
Come on! Permission?
I can see the judgment all over that generic face of yours.
There are a few things from my childhood... I wish I could just forget.
Oh, my God, that's a scary thought.
I've been called to Kabul for an off-the-record meeting with some civilian bigwig.
That looks like pastel chalk to me.
I'm bringing in all available resources... threat-management unit, dedicated forensics team...
How'd I get here?
Yeah. That's-that's Steve.
And you will be out when I say you're out.
M. Sec wants that report from the working group today.
Young man! Cyberbullying is grounds for expulsion.
In 2016, you're gonna see the true amateur that we develop here in the United States and we've done since the early 1900s for the Olympics, you're gonna see them competing against pros.
The only way I was able to escape was to fake my own death.
Jump on, canter, and hop over that meter-high fence there.
- Goodbye, goodbye. - Don't say hello or goodbye.
Some of it will be good. Some of it will be bad.
She's just walked in.
I like to think you have good taste in men.
Well, for now.
And everything else.
What are you doing?
Thank you, for dinner.
We'll all be doomed.
Most people think the danger in a situation like this is the cold.
Hear his testimony firsthand, look him in the eye when he tells his story.
- You have to go.
All aboard! You could say in boxing, to be the best, you've got to get beat up by the best.

She buys me a "MAD" magazine that night, apologizes.
Full scenes of crime?
17-year old Eli Bello was caught on tape trying to steal a cell from a bodega in Yonkers.
Look, you got caught up, but there is time to be a leader for your crew.
Heaves him off the cliff, all in broad daylight.
Yeah, it has its moments.
That's why we found you loitering by the clubhouse that morning.
Just a look.
Are you working on your resume?
Hey, we got a job to do.
Phil... he lives alone.
Because I didn't feel bad.
Uh... before you say anything...
Are you having a seizure?
- Sam, that's Mr. Williams'.
- Two million.
This is about you being jealous of Alex.
I just move 'em through.
He was a personal trainer at one of those ritzy gyms down the loop.
We reviewed the hotel security footage from the corridor.
I told you before, I've been worried for my brother for a while.
I was just giving my statement.
You and I, we had a moment.
-I have tried explaining it to her.
So you'd better calm down and start preparing everything for Guzmán's arrival.
You get to keep all your fingers and toes.
- and look into what it might mean.
- Sustained. The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun?
You got five minutes.
I assume you have a reservation?
Well, if we do that, it won't just be the FBI coming.
It wouldn't be right.
- You haven't told me anything.
I almost want to say, "Man, I can't believe she..."
You can call me Tess.
What are you talking about?
Eric gave us the Death Kings' stash house.
Ce ne sera pas tres difficile.
Everything about it.
Oh, Vivian, thank you for the dance.
Just like you already know that Louis kills for you out there whether he's taking your calls or not.
Hey, don't be scared, she's not a zombie.
- What are you doing?
- Please, come with us.
Forget about it.
- What's going on?
Are you serious?
-Damn it, Zyan!
How would you know that? And-and how do you know how much I make?
For what, chicken and waffles?
There's no need to call an idea stupid.
You know, we should exchange numbers.
You took that which I love, so I will take from you everything you have and everything you have ever been.
Owen ever say anything to you about leaving his wife?
Local police, maybe?
Are you reaching for the string?
I pulled this from Plata Fuego's Web site.
It's not like she hasn't been dicked around by Ferguson.
Well done again on the promotion, Simon.
And if you're telling me some girl is pregnant, then, I mean, that's amazing.
I will be back in one second.
Excellent. And on a related point, you're going down, punk.
Wow, that's great, Linds.
- Oh, I see.
See you in hell!
She's... She's loaded.
How naïve you are.
That he would be no longer be needed.
There you are.
Wouldn't surprise me.
He just made her laugh, something's wrong.
A frickin' tarantula almost bit my frickin' arm off!
Either sold it on the street, maybe did it himself?
I'm not making up the fact that Don's gone missing.
I just panicked.
I gotta poop.
Sandy guaranteed that this wouldn't happen again!
What are you doing?
Perfect gift for the perfect couple.
It's the small things.
- You have a deal.
Move along, Nick Cannon.
Okay, listen to me.
How is Zach?
You heard what Leanne said.
I didn't get the feeling that, "Oh, okay.
Company was lacking.
And that's fine, is it?
Well, it's the last day of camp, so once again, it's time for all of you to grab that one last kiss, last dance, last... [chuckles] Well, you know what I mean.
We won't let you win.
I committed murder.
- I want a new door. - Okay, man.
And then, when you come back, you just just get passed and passed again.'
We're gonna plan something so special.
You've been told not to talk to me.
Depends on whether a planet-killing asteroid is heading our way.
Yeah. I'm gonna need some spinal fluid from your snake.
Now you give the key to him.
Right now, I have a situation. Someone's trying to kill my witness, Makino.
What is it you're looking for?
It's obvious someone colluded here, Liz.
Everything was perfectly squared.
There's a long way to go before we can make that decision, I get that but, you know, he is co-operating.
But do you remember the song?
Your men coming or not?
Cora died when she left this house.
This is, essentially, an instantaneous event.
It's getting clearer.
I was defending myself.
Just like each other.
Or why Bob's obsessed with the muck heap.
- OK, I'm on my way.
Okay, Titus, there are adult Lindas, right?
I've put some of that poison you had in the box, I put some of that down in a couple of saucers, so just be careful.
They had a secret meeting in his compound in the middle of the night. not The Washington Post.
My family, my cleaner, my tax agent.
Um, thank you for understanding.
I will, but not because you said so.
- Yes. - Are you gonna settle down?
It followed him around like a dark cloud.
- You said it made it easier.
In the novels that I write, nobody dies.
I am not sure.
And I was wiping her face and just saying:
The V.A. might not pay for it.
-This time, I will make it known around the world!
The point is, is you just don't give up.
I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think Amy is my daughter.
Yeah, Mum's screams.
It's not like Sal's lab equipment was ever used.
I won't lie.
What's going on?
There are plenty of YA novels that are every bit as good as adult books. What?
Sherlock and I started looking into the other divorcés that Roy was investigating.
What am I gonna tell the kids?
Secondly, they're going to have a series of security questions, the specifics of which I can't predict.
Hera always saw something special in you, and so did I.
What just happened?
- Two or three.
I'll take the first verse this time.
I'm busy, sorry.
And when I come back... when I come back, you and me... we're not gonna see each other anymore.
No respirators needed.
Yes, Mr. Secretary.
They can't find the plane.
I can't imagine either scenario would go down very well with your constituents.
It's been years since I last saw him.
"Ooh, aren't we clever?
Look how great you all look. So beautiful.
Maybe he was acting suspiciously because you were interrogating him with a broomstick.
The creature will get you.
- Doesn't matter.
Let's knock at the neighbour's.
You can see us?
Do yourself a favor and give us some space.
Then get me in to see Tahir.
I mean, they've probably been looking for Nick all this time.
He is earning and spending well within his government salary.
Yeah, well, he would be if I wasn't out here asking him so many questions about, you know, how to... how to patch a tire, but... like he said, the directions are written clearly down
- Enough now!
It was a chaotic night, babies everywhere.
Activate the team.
- Yeah, they're fine.
I accepted as many roles as I could possibly play.
- You've been sticking your nose in.
We didn't sneak anything.
-I'm going to buy some water.
- I trust you with my heart.
You're the reason Shinwell is in a coffin.
Get a move on.
You kept me waiting longer than I thought.
She never actually specified
Got to run.
She's my daughter... and she needs me.
Everything that happened during the shooting in the airport is just as what the PGR said in the news.
- Ha! - No.
Give him what he's asking for.
Allie, you know the girls.
And we're still dealing with it every day.
- You took Emma to get an abortion?
You are about to transcend, dear.
Neil, Neil! Check it out, check it out!
Is that more news of Sonja?
It's usually kids eating paint chips.
Elena, was he the man chasing you?
Yes, we worked together.
Even if doing the right thing... means not having you back?
No, probably not.
For all I know, you could be a psycho.
Do you still suspect Craig Petrie?
This is she.
Everything all right?
I didn't think you'd have the balls to show up.
And a pretty flirty one, at that.
Our prints are all over that van, and the only proof we didn't do this is gone.
At the house, last night.
You want to help me put away the groceries?
There are so many clothes.
Nobody else wanted it.
What the hell is that?
- Undo the cuff! - Argh!
- What's my window?
I didn't do anything.
Blood money that he makes from selling drugs.
Perhaps installing malware and keyloggers on their computers and phones.
- Wow. So how long are you gonna be in town?
An accident on 287 north of Parsippany has one northbound lane closed all the way out past...
Give me a reason.
Look, we can't live in fear.

I found out Min-woo is alive.
Oh, how sweet.
Then I am fortunate.
Look, I know you're only apologizing to me to get your bus back.
Internet's free, so I'll do some research.
- It's OK.
Jamie, how did you find...
-The question is just being accepted?
Okay, okay, good. I didn't wanna hear a story about you searching for your biological father. - Shut the fuck up, Joe.
A government-issued safe from which classified documents were stolen.
Yet at the same time...
Dr. Eduard Acosta discovered an asteroid large enough to cause an extinction-level event.
You're sure about this?
If the list has to do with Min-woo, the culprit must be on it too.
It doesn't count.
Appeal for dreams.
Wow, this virus is moving through Thiago like jerky through Cabe.
I was so happy.
Oh, nasi goreng is my fav.
Do you recognize this document, Mr. Anders?
Maybe speaking it out loud might help.
- Okay, tomorrow?
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
- Are you sure?
It's outside and there's jack shit I can do about it.
There you go.
And glass in shapes you've never seen, thin as paper.

And that was my idea.
You're a fool.

But if you lay a finger on her, I will fuckin' kill you myself.
You had a surgery.

I think it was possibly Sean Mercer.
Well, the water was freezing!
Oh, great, I will call Callen.

I'd wish you the best, but I don't think you'll need it.
[Anna] I'd like to form an alliance with you.
The bunk room is so disgustingly dirty...

That's just a formality in these cases.
I don't wanna drop everything right now.

That'd be easiest, wouldn't it?
I'll buy you a bigger one later.
The fact that you stayed with that book at all, which is basically a love story between two men.

I care about Jose Mendoza, my T.O. who died in my arms.
Deep down, she feels unworthy.
All of the modes are.
He never showed up?
In that case, I'd like to interview Emilia Urquiza.
The girls that work for me know their value.
Do you think Dad is screwing Mom now that they're sharing a bed?
- Looking pretty good so far.
That's why they're coming for your children... but now they think we're a military target.
From someone specific, too.
Shall we, Constable?
You're here for Austin.
How embarrassing will it be if we show up to the reunion and we're still just hangin' out?
No one knows where he is.
Had I known... what kind of sick...
- Give it up.
Now, it's your turn.
What was I supposed to do?
Vera, I am so sorry.
Mosca! Mosca, don't give up!

I turned him down.
But what you did at the G20.
All right, Danny. Put us behind the SWAT van. That's our cover.

Really good; with her police training, she'd already eliminated three other contestants.
Last thing we need is Chen seeing some report that Reeves is still alive.
Just... We have to get out of here before the nurse comes back. Come on.

If it was your 'right' - why didn't he just give it to you?
And I'm the bad guy.
And there was no talking them into it.
- I took care of Mike.
It's not proven at all.

Now, are you gonna be part of the problem, or are you the solution?
It's staffed 24 hours a day.
There's two of you and one of me.

Alberto Minoleta of Paraguay has just been taken into custody by the police.
Yes, I am, why?
The stuff after that.
Don't you do that
Yes, and if you come out of the ship now, they'll see you and wreck time itself.
Come on, let's go.
- 'Cause we all pulled together to get back on solid footing, and I saw the two of you huddled up in here earlier, and I'd hate to think that things are going in the wrong direction.
And I nev... I didn't even know what a douche was.
- Unless what?
You handle El Puño.
Do you know how unbelievable it all sounds, right?
Hey, did he forget hump day?
What is that?
Get his ass canned by the Trustees.
How many times did you see him?
- Just guard Will.
You know what happens now.
What am I not gonna do?
Politically speaking, Officer Gagliano and all of our 35,000 cops are my constituents.
Get out of the car now and let me see your hands!
Douglas Hamilton, you are under arrest.
Well, I was.
The day we met, you asked how I got my scar.
- No. Absolutely not. - No.
It's in the Tombs. "The Tombs"? Yeah, that's not ominous at all.
It keeps going straight to voicemail. Kim, when people go out all night, their phones die.
No. No, we don't.
Madame Beauvais, the evidence has been presented.
Two guys just came by with the transfer papers.
That's from the drone.
To do what?
These people don't, and neither do I.
I am so hungry that I could eat a horse. Zoe!
I wouldn't say that I was creating problems.
And I'm not comfortable with the way we're treating victims.
There was meant to be.
It doesn't look airworthy.
We gotta go. No, no, no!
It has to be insulated.
Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in.
I've been unable to bring myself to do anything about the baby situation.
- No, I got two facial lacs and a syncope patient to wrap up.
Yeah, I want another delivery.
Pops, is it really safe to believe what this thing says?
You got to trust me.
I assumed that he was staggering because he was drunk.
He said, "I was in a bar fight."
Whatever are you feeding her?
Now, Zoe, as your father, it's my duty to tell you that going after those thieves was dangerous and reckless and... I had no choice.
'Cause no matter what you think of me, we both love New Orleans!
Yeah and what about our passports?
Get the fuck out.
That's from The Root of All Evil.
What happened with Dylan?
These motherfuckers practicing without me.
His brothers have a vendetta against me.
- It doesn't matter, alright?
She said it's a matter of life and death.
They want to see you at the review board at 9:00 a.m.

Townsmead says the revolver was a .455.
Deeks, we're gonna get Kensi, but we're gonna do this together.
South Bronx Killers?
You said you didn't know him.
I calculate a 31% risk of the rebels successfully using the codes, but we have an 82% chance of learning the location of their base if we let them escape and track them.
It's going to win technical awards for sure.
Since when have they been linked?
Now you're being ridiculous.
Well, go on. Spend 100 years seeing it, then 100 years wrecking it.
Don't go down the same rabbit hole as Red did.
Mia, don't be stupid.
Just a little further.

That's the truck.
TATSUYUKI MICHIMA, TOKYO
Fresh out of the academy.
Look, we're getting nowhere with Eli, so tell me you found something on the missing kids or their foster mom.
He's a priest, but I think he really wanted to be a police like his brother.
He hopes I soon feel better and he longs for the day we meet.
Now you got to tell me what's up.
The entire school is under our control, including its mutt of a mascot.
The sacrifice heroes make.
My uncle was killed, too.
Yeah, I know.
-Shut up, asshole!
We heard there was a party out here.
That means I'm dead no matter what I tell you.
We're going to hospital.
That's why the Hechnian president built their space program.

OFFICIAL RESIDENCE MEXICO CITY
I ain't working for Dad again.
You had a new fiancee at the time. A whole life waiting.
I'm not going to the police.
What is this?
Damn it, Charles.
Apparently the same weapon was used in the Ruffalo murder.
But that's exactly what you're doing.
Is it a patient?
- Alpha One on-site.
And I need her to call me back as soon as possible.
You must be dehydrated.
I'm so sorry.
Abigail's still tied up at 11:17.
This letter arrived for him after he left.
I'll go speak to him kindly, respectfully, about his press conferences.
There is no "buts," Dwayne.
And I didn't feel they believed me then, and I doubt that there are people who will believe... now.
I don't really give a shit.
- Yeah, it really was.
And I use the term "ladies" very loosely.
Why's Mark's bag open?
You're welcome, seriously.
Just as long as I get to say I told you so.
Now the real judgment begins.
And when the police found her car, they had proof of a bank transaction.
Well, that's what I want, too.
The girls will just not talk to us.
The key is communication. The lock is trust.
Just underscoring the seriousness of the situation. - That, well... - Excuse me.
Yeah, but I had to.
This'll be fun.
How are you calling from a 000 area code?
Check it out.
You're cray, okay?
Ready to roll. Like you read my mind.
Okay, so... you said that it has its moments.
"How" is I retraced your steps on Tuesday and found it in the pool.
Here's the scary thing:
Wish me luck.

It's just one battery.
We're in the right place.
Lately I've been staring in the mirror a lot, and every day, the person looking back looks more and more like Benny, and I don't want that future.
Matthew Katzman, Kristen Hargis,
That's the only way I get to see them anymore.
That's all you need.
Hermit crab racing?
- And I have plans with Noah.
- Give me that.
Have you talked to the children about this?
Spotted by whom?
- About the bar?
That'll be 1,500 won.
You can make it out to Kidnap Solutions LLC.
Remember our training, lure them in then shoot!
Tell me everything?
That's all I can say.
It seems you've racked up quite a gambling debt.
- Is she conscious?
Hey, listen, I know a lot of people have let you down, but I'm not one of them.
- Rufus! - Hey!
This is Emily Stone from the CPS, who'll be working alongside us at Span from here on in.

His pro debut, no jitters.
Dr. Leighton, cut.
He got them from Phil Righetti, who got them from his money launderer, who says they're copies of everything Nanette Vlasik asked him for.
When was the last time you talked to her?
People wanted to know what this was about.
Are you serious? Right.
I don't know.
Yeah, by the time backup gets here they'll find us dead.
Remember, it was the '60s.
Look at me.
That's even scarier than thinking that I have to drink this coffee for one more day.
This is my office and where the girls wait on standby.
I know you're upset because you feel you aren't there for your child, but you were there for mine today.
Oh, come on.
Lots of... stuff.
It could have been Edgar Davidson.
- Chairman Cho!
Here's to long days, short nights, and wondering if you're saying the wrong thing every time your new boss talks to you.
How much notice have you given?
Is everything okay?
Does she need you to come back? No.
So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?
And we have 23 and a half hours to make something work.
Hey, you work for us, Cristobal.
In justice? Yeah.
Hey. I'm gonna take the couch tonight.
I don't want you to get hurt.
And tonight's your night, bro.

The key's in the wheel well.
Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil?
You're gonna go Gabby Dawson on this, aren't you?
- Don't be ridiculous.
Did you go with him?
I hope we're not interrupting anything.
She's gonna testify and after she does, all those other girls, they're gonna follow suit.
- Get out of the fucking...
You got any plans?
It's about a mile across.
I feel lucky Richard chose me.
He fought for her, practically to the death.

What if there were a spot for you at another house?
Henry. You should've done this the easy way. 'Cause my curse is still coming.
- She's not in.
When we spoke on the phone, it sounded like you were willing to cooperate.
I am a novelist.

That had ended, there was some guilt.
You can't play boxing.
Annie, he was here.
I've never seen him so calm.
This is famiglia.
Um, I don't belong here.

Please just get out of here.
I slept with him, OK? - Stupid.
Two of them, then, please, Julie.
I don't want to see it and be reminded of it.
I know this isn't your first time, but we have no room for error here.
- Oh, yeah, I know it. - You do? I live in Dorchester.
This "masculine mode" of presenting oneself is falsely unpretentious.
"A bad dream"!
When I returned, they had taken my wife.

No, I know what you mean.

Once we were stateside, I was in charge of it.

My sister Giovanna often fought with him for this reason. - I will be back soon.
Peter Quillin had a reputation of being just one of the meanest men in the ring.
Tell us everything.
It's getting scary.
We can't thank you enough for helping to save this camp.
I'm not defensive.

All right, I heard it in a podcast Anna was listening to.
A lie, and I trust you have a good number of witnesses to support it?

It worked. He's breathing.
I was investigating it, Emilia.

No prints. Patrol's canvassing the area looking for witnesses, but they got nothing yet.
Maybe I can identify which syndicate we're dealing with, and then we'll make the connections that they have at the docks.
I remember looking away, and I shook my head, and she...
Never heard of that.
And I promise... so did you.
Why are you grilling me all of a sudden?
There's my sister!
I'm a businessman.
It's a gun.
Have they caught the thieves yet?
Well, what's the occasion? - Wedding.
Do you mind?
After we put their sons away, we'll put them away as well for attempting to pervert the course of justice.
I can speak for myself, thank you.
I have to do everything myself, don't I?

Yeah, on the other hand, two people are already dead 'cause of those guns.
- I barely even know her!
He's a murderer, Annie.
Goddess of wisdom.
No, I think you shouldn't kill me 'cause you need me.
It felt as if at some point... that terrible terror of doing this... s... turned into something else.
How far are we willing to go?
And eggs and bagels.
Paige returned my favorite sweatshirt.
Like, at all. If my mom knew we were here, she would totally flip.
- But you were at his parole?
-This is it.
Well, until the urine tests come back, we can't be 100% sure, but headaches, nausea, blurred vision...
We have a settlement meeting tomorrow, and this is the last we will speak about it ever again. - Louis...
- How is it clear?
I know it's gonna be him.
I love you.
Come on, come on, come on...
I've always found it one of your most commendable qualities, that you're more forgiving of other people than you are of yourself.
Flights to the Caymans, the Bahamas, the Cook Islands.
Car's there, as soon as you turn.
I mean, I'm going... I was going.
All of us.
I'm gonna take off.
- Just like everyone else does.
Becky's phone is definitely here, somewhere.
How long were you watching me?
- Hi. - Hi.
Captain, are you still there?
Because everybody thinks this is an unsupervised trash house.
I didn't know NYPD used consultants.
We're hoping you could answer that question.
You want an apocalypse?
I got here as soon as I could, but the situation at the border is the least of our problems.
I don't think so.
Come on out!
The White House.
That's very kind of you, Mrs March, but, um, he wants... he wants nothing more to do with me.

Is it serious with this fellow?
We can talk when I get back from the ranch.
The music teacher... any idea why Eli was trying to find him?
In the third world somewhere.
- What are we doing here?

That night, I called Rick Woy, and I told him that Mike had fired Steve Tully... and that I wondered if he would meet with me in the sacristy and we could pray, because I always found that I got insight and direction with prayer,

- Could he have posted it to his kids? - What? When?
Only now, you work for me.
- during your testimony.
Really, it's gonna be okay.
They're the same guys you had problems with.
You're a grown man.
Judging by decomp, I would estimate they've been dead six months.
It does that. - _.
DON ISMAEL BOSS
Listen to me...
Don't make me regret this.
I mean, to get them on the road to a healthier lifestyle.
Have you been to see her?
Look at that. - Not bad.
Great. Why don't the both of you come outside with us?
I would never leave you.
All right? I was just making it up as I went along.
Uh, Dr. Torres, I'm Agent Goodkin, this is Agent Clark.
I'll get that fucker.
- You know I was seeing a psychiatrist last year, right?
I'll start scanning for anything suspicious now.
He just doesn't like retirement.
Won't that be awfully small?
He knows where Teresa Mendoza is. And wherever Teresa is, so is Camila.
Should I cut your lying tongue...
Only the best for you, but, please, keep the music down, okay?
One of the things that when I talked to parents, when I talked to Dr. Hu, that it was important to sort of get in context with for how it completely consumes your life.

Why don't you visit with your friend - and we'll talk later. - Yeah.
It gives me the willies.
Ask you what?
Whether I was sexually active.
We just want to make you one of ours.
And that's their legacy, and what will his legacy be?
How did you do it?
Ella's going to be coming home to you.
Then let's go!
Young lady... I'd appreciate a little help.
You were right.
I love watching you work!
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, your partner, now.
Leave the necklace and get out of my sight!
Only if he's throwing stones at the window.
Both of you.
He's been so supportive lately, not doubting me as much.
I'll push him to lean on his government contacts and get the emergency call-and-response code we'll need to order these planes to land.
They're not gonna be happy with us when this is all over.
- Kaz, can you hear me?
Look, Heather's going through a tough time.
Ease up! You think he's gonna answer questions 'cause you asked nicely?
So my friend is here?
I'm warning you.
He needs medical attention.
I couldn't tell you the last time we saw anyone.
And it had... It didn't look like it had anything in it.
- They grill you?
Again with the foot!
Everything all right?
But we'll take revenge against the Avendaños.
She was worried what the staff would think.
The first telegraph... the first streetlights... the trains.
"Um, has anyone seen Coop or Ginny?"
And now, I kiss yours.
And five extra for your guys.
Cam F. Awesome got his first win tonight.
- Might give him a heart attack though.
And well worth defending, by the way. Or hiring someone to defend.
That's it, that's it.
Really adds some shine.
I mine AV weaknesses.
We came here for your business, for your help.
The other is the witness, Jane Doe... a student at the Catholic high school where Sister Cathy taught.
You were shot.
For sure, D-Train.
I don't want anything to do with that world, or anyone in it.
Your long-lost baby sister murdered 200 people and counting.

Why do you ask?
All I got on under this thing is a Beefy-T.
No, thank you, Zahid.
What exactly are you called again?
You seen it before?
I know you've had a breakthrough.
Wondering if you're ever gonna see your kid again,
Never mind. Well, if we're supposed to be partners, we should pontificate together.
Okay, so what do you suggest, telekinesis maybe?
Look, things will work themselves out, but you've gotta chill, Franky.
Don't make me laugh.
It happened the way it happened.
That would be mountain stream, yeah.
In this case, I'm a messenger with an offer that could save your life.
Elizabeth, if you get out of the car, you choose Raymond.
I'm starting to wonder if he's ever gonna talk.
I've spent the last ten years creating new species of hybrids and spreading them across the globe.
Nice to meet you, Killy.

She didn't want to have kids.
Please don't hurt me.

At least four people have been murdered, and I'm not one for vague assurances from the intelligence community.
But Ruby's a different kettle of fish altogether.

Dr. Bansal is clearly too cute to be guilty of anything.
Well, keep me apprised of any developments. I want this to remain a priority.

Pathetic little thing she is.
I don't want to do what she told me.
Her public defender has washed his hands.
Well, that would raise a number of problems.
- I don't know.
You go missing, then you mysteriously hurt your hand, and t...
What about electronic surveillance?
Well, well, my mother, my sister, a few of the higher-ups here at Farraday.
The guy with the milky abs? Oh.
Well, what can you do?
Yesterday, the shelf was full, now half the packets are gone.
Must be the battery.
I would never do that.
No one can seem to find Special Agent Reade and serve him his subpoena.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh, I've heard the rumors, Raymond.
This is the first time that anything happened with the people from there, yeah?
The Jedi are yours, but my daughter...
I can't do that.

Can you tape his mouth shut?
You claim the Aufieros made an attempt on your life while you were in hiding.
I found a lot of someones.
Nanaka Hiraki figured out who sent the invitations, and was murdered.

Moving down in weight, I get to fight guys my own size and I feel so much better.
That's not all. Oh, right.

I have to get back to Jackson.
So what did you do after you left Latch's?
- Will you accept my apology?
Getting out of here.
Come on, Maggie.
Sorry to interrupt. There's a call for Lindsay on line three.
I am listening.
Oh, yeah, I know that.
There's not a day in her life where she did not break some law somewhere.
Something I can help you with?
I need an answer.
-I have to tell you something.
I'll put the kettle on.
At first, I think so.
We don't know yet.
[Clara] I got to do better.
They do nothing to us.
You know, it would really help if I knew where we were going, you know.
- Stop the car.
Son, you have to be careful.
But I like to go out and take my body for a walk peacefully.
And I can't think of anything better than to be able to give one of them a good home.
Look, if they want to pay me to sit in a warm classroom instead of freezing my ass off helping the citizens of Chicago, then be my guest.
- They probably should have put in concrete.
That's where you're wrong.
Then maybe you should stop.
Well, what is it then?
See you in 5 minutes!
When was the last time you saw her?
And that's when I saw Him coming down the driveway in the faces of my mother, my brother, my father.
This isn't working.
Now, that's a start.
Honestly, I think somewhere down the line, a miscommunication developed between us and I take full responsibility for that. I get it.
That's our operating theory.
Are you in pain?
It's a boy... A healthy baby boy.
A torch-wielding killer, a stolen boat and an offshore oil rig.

All summer long, Willie had a huge crush on this shy girl named Vivian.
The fingernails were extracted postmortem.

We're gonna take the whole thing with us.
I haven't seen anything.
MCRN Command is going to need your cooperation with the investigation on Ganymede.
It's not like that.
I'll be right back. Excuse me.
I hadn't seen you here before.
Yeah, I was waiting for you to catch on. I thought I was gonna have to send up flares.
This one was a prison break.
Do I have to draw you a picture?
I can't do this!
We've heard testimony that your task force has allowed Reddington to commit violent crimes and done nothing to stop it.
That's a thing?
Well, yeah. I was trying to say no in, like, a giggly way.
Forget about Dolls, be your own woman.
There's an off-the-record sex crimes detective who goes under the name Deep Throat who claims, uh, that the state's attorney's office ran interference in favor of the Church in these cases, and what would your response to that be?
Brandon, you are so talented.
This guy again.
Frankie was in a band when he was in med school, and I had the...
Major likes to be told what to do.
What do you do if you got to move gold, but you know all your outs are covered?
They run when they're scared.
- So he paid someone else to do it.

Thanks to these women, my life will change a lot.
And, uh, Mr. GQ-- I take it that's your next mark?
You were right.
Get the CCTV footages!
-DID HE TRIP?
Bind her to us.
Ignorance is safer... but it isn't bliss.
This little government tantrum could not have come at a worse time.
Not just inside these walls, but all over.
I can read it.
This isn't the first time.
Is everything okay, sir?
That's 'cause you've never done it before. And-and the truth is, it's... sweet.
But I didn't...
- Like I said, I thought it was routine...
Yeah, yeah, just down the hall.
Get her on the bed.
It doesn't feel like me.
You know it's not, sweetheart.
And the winner, by a knockout, Navy Petty Officer Johnny Rudd!
It's mandatory. The eve of your 63rd birthday.
I'm Lois Lane, and clearly it's been a slow news day.
So, we don't know... how many students in total he had inappropriate contact with.
It makes no sense.
Right now, you need a bit of fresh oxygen and then we got to save the others. Okay? All right.
'The press know we've an operation running.
I guess about 10 years ago when he was 13.
Here you go.
Whatever happens, we're here for you.
You wanted to talk?
She's been abducted.
If he doesn't want to be found, he'll just disappear.
I have nothing for you.
I know you're aware of this, but I need to remind you that everything we discuss is covered by attorney-client privilege.
See you tomorrow at the baby shower.
I wanted to make sure things were just as uncomfortable for you as they were for me.
If you thought 39 missing people was bad, imagine what will happen once they get that information.
The lost city of Shangri-La.
Rosebud... is that what they were after?
Save it for the vows.
- This is perfect.
And let's just put it down to "heat of the moment" madness.
This is a sophisticated operation.
[Canek] You wanted to redeem yourself.
That's all you need to know.
He helped get us out.
See if they have any information from Fire Prevention.
Okay. Speaking colleague to colleague, "Working out a mutually beneficial arrangement."
I'll help you.
Uh, I-I don't know where he is.
Ship, top, bottom, see?
Shouldn't it beep or something?
Oh. Should I interrupt?
- it'd be boring, Booms.
I don't understand.
A symbol near and dear to Lewis' heart.
I make mistakes.
I'm your first real emotionally-connected relationship.
You were saying, about Tariq and Amber...
How'd a jerk like me get so lucky?
Meet you in our room?
Please recall what the tattooed man looks like.
How do I know some old geezer isn't hiding somewhere, ready to give me another concussion?
So, how come you and Jack broke up?
The prosecutor kept her locked up for three years before starting her trial.
Please, just... Please, just...
- this doesn't mean anything.
He works in different places.
Less than a month ago, I got an e-mail from a woman.
This is really her story.
That's why I called him home. - It's okay. Where is it?
I can't do it.
Out of the car!
That building's gonna collapse any second.
Alright, alright, alright.
- Yo, yo. - How did that go?
They're- - They're people that you know.
That's Officer Wrigley to you.
Oh, that's unfortunate.
Guys, hang on, i'm starting to get that "i shouldn't be doing this" feeling, like that time I ate 30 eggs.
I want to know who this random girl is and what's going on.
You let the secretary's errand boys wander into something they weren't qualified to deal with.
And I'm so frikkin' excited to be here with the '07 Champs to announce that, this spring, ground will be broken on the brand new Gardner Community Centre!
We need something that we could use as backdrops for photos or... or hangout nooks.
Gather around, please.
"Because I love novels."
- Um, it's Pearson now.
What the hell are you doing?
So whatever you're cooking up, better make it fast.
Look at that thing! Looks like a train ran over it.
Perhaps if I see a few monuments to democracy, I could get the creative engine moving.
You're so bold, Mr. Sakurai!
To what end?

As the score is tied, whoever wins this will be crowned King of Camp.
They were flown by chopper to San Francisco General.

Just 'cause you fuck her doesn't mean you know her.
You do it because you care.
I mean, I didn't even know you had a brother, and then this guy shows up at the flower stand, and he's calling out my name. It was incredible.
We earned those coupons last month.
If I'd given him 50%, I would've been left with nothing.
Well, the one...
I don't know, either.
- Donna, before you go home tonight, I need you to cut me a check for Holly.
You got to put the fear of God in 'em.
You've got a long way before you turn pro.
Agent Hanna, my client does not work at the store 24/7.
Does this commemorate something?
Drawings can't be either.
Captain, if you would.
Come on, man.
- Anything, guys?
That's fuckin' crazy!
It does nothing to change the shit this country is going through.
- Um... - See, I promise not to look.
Well, no, why don't we say 9:30 and then make it your beeswax to be here at 9:30?
Son of a bitch! We're going to die!
And then we'll go back and clean up this little guy.
- Yeah, just give me a minute.
No, I'm-- Get off.
So, I will be waiting for the phone call and the taco.
I was at his house earlier looking for Olivia.
We don't have much time, so here's what I know.

So why don't you invite 'em in for dinner?
Is it called She-lumbia?
Since when do the feds run an operation in this city without including the NYPD?
Would you say that your relationship was purely professional?
When she touches down, the location's yours.
Keyes has them all writing their wills.
I'm saying we didn't start it.
This was gonna be your Christmas present, Sam.
They'll never catch her. Echo's a spy. This is what she does.
I mean, that story's practically guaranteed to go viral.
How long can we bat cleanup?
She had the waddle and everything.
You could have escaped from that ship.
Tell me everything you want the police to know.
I am trying to apologize. Look at this. You know what?
-There's no way. were found at the scene.
Give him drones.
Oh, wait, I did. Every day for the last 11 months.
I spoke with Davis.
I passed out.
Paid him half a million dollars because he didn't want to take a chance on losing.
How are you, Mare?
- It does at Baker Simms and Walker Stein.
There has to be another way, another tunnel.
Suddenly, your law and order campaign seems much more urgent and then the votes roll in.
It's horse thieves.
Do I look confident to you?
You know... the hair.
- That's not sick!
- there's nothing of note.
- I didn't fuckin' kill him.
Travel as a man.
Some of these are still frozen in the middle.
If anything were to happen to you, I could never forgive myself.
It's not real, brother.
We mash the seed, a little alcohol to break down the cell walls, voilà... the sequencer should read it.
I need condoms to have sex.
But anybody holding this thing is a target.
- All right, see you later, Mom.
Your freckled nose. Your freckles have gone quite a lot now.
Jonjo's phone's just ringing out.
That is if you don't mind me sticking my nose in... No, no.
Another few days in here and I'll be a free woman.
Hang on, Tom! Don't let go!
The field said no.
Colt didn't come back.
This is the only thing.
And Joe's parents raised a hero, so, really, how bad can they be?
Hmm? If you ever want to see a paycheck, fill out your W-4 ASAP and give it to the guy that... Vic...
Hey, that your patient from the oil field?
I get why you want to track down Jackson as he and his crazy father are the bastards who started this all, but you can't solve all the world's problems.
What about our sweet friend Perez, huh?
What mistake, Tench?
All right, have a great night.
Thank you. Thank you.
Raymond and I prefer to keep my role in his affairs to ourselves.
Oh, and don't bother going to the board.
Two hours, Watson.
I'm sorry, T.C.
The new Iron Curtain falling over Eastern Europe,
Hold on a sec, General.
To look after Clem, which is something I couldn't have done on account of me dying to save the world.
I want to get a good spot.
No privacy on this damn island.
- Leave he alone!
Who's Missy Dietler?
Where's this coming from?
I know that. And I'm really thankful.
Uh, there is one that uses exclusively back alleys, but the cameras are all closed-circuit.
I'm COO of this firm, so instead of criticizing me for working late, why don't you go see what he wants?
Gary, you used to cook food in this place, and if memory serves, it tasted like bunk-rot pilaf.
In one line.
"NTs" for short.
Mr. Ross, when you do what I do, you get used to people assuming the worst about your company, so I would appreciate a little respect.
[chuckles] I banged half of bunk seven in this cot.
Tried to get her to speak at a company event for years.
More than clean.
I'm so sorry.
GCS 3, intubated in the field.
Will you excuse me?
Not at all.
He chose Jackson.
Stop it, Debbie.
But give him a break, will you?
See you later then.
And what about Ramón?
The first lady's been murdered.
I asked the police about that.
Whoa... Hey, I'm just gonna sit this one out, okay?
I swear to you, that's the truth.
The street I live in.
When I'm here alone, I can hear the souls of the city.
Well, I was the lieutenant on duty... in Halethorpe at the time the body was found.
Are you implementing phase two?
Your dad's right, bro.
Getting the word out... allowed Homeland Security to stop four other attacks, but... two buildings just came down. One in Boston, one in San Francisco. Oh, my God.
And, of course, once they are assembled they're painted over there, packed over there and collected and shipped out.
You can say his name.
I already tried.
It's what's causing his symptoms.
- Not yours?
But if want to stay alive, I'd show those cops some good faith.
Just, uh, I'll be right back.
Shut up, please, okay?
Uh, I know you've been through Hell.
Can you cover your arms, please?
This is bad.
You're feeling isolated, I get that.
I mean, the big ones are still around right?
Lionel Wilkins. He worked at both Mount Pleasant and the Millburn correctional facility.
I've never met a French person before.
This better be good. I'm about to dive into a world of knights and ghosts and...
You're damn right.
I'll save you the trouble.
The cleanup was, uh... messy.
That won't hold very long.
He invented planetsaving technology in record time, which we are perilously close to losing.
You have the right to an attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning.
Because I just took it last month.
Kate, do we know someone desperate enough to go on a date with Randall?
Look, if you're in trouble...
We didn't have enough evidence to hold him.
Does anybody else want to try anything foolish?
Diane, Thomas... and you follow them around all day.
Are you sure you want to work from Los Pinos?
He's driving on Fifth Avenue. He's driving south through Juárez.
And I was so pissed... that I built a rocket.
Happy memories, big smiley faces.
I'll put a BOLO out.
- She's got a point.
What do you want me to do about the women?
I'd like to hold off on that.
After all this time, The Falcon's remained out of reach.
I got it.
Hey, is anyone in the bathroom?
You've made your choices in life just like Qasim.
Shh! I'm trying to listen.
It's the kids.
I like her a lot because she is... free.
Here we go.
What's the matter, honey? - Dan.
So, I went out and did it myself.
And we're glad the others are free.
All right. Call the State's Attorney. Get a sneak and peek warrant.
I've actually had the... "lying in your own pool of blood" moment, so I get it.
Like on the phone with no texting and talk to her.
You want me to...
Wow. That's your first kiss, huh?
Yeah, up in Kingston, mostly.
I'm driving over there.
Not till I left this place.
- Maybe you were wrong about the bins?
And... he asked me about your drug habit.
They burn from the inside out.
They're gonna beat you again.
What's it cost to go here, like, ten, 15 grand?
And so, even though I was getting really good grades in, um, academic subjects, he wanted me to take shorthand and business courses as well.
They'll protect their power and their money.
We might have a problem.
She's got a point, Elvis.
Death in the family, I think.
It's our last option, Toño.
I remember one time he was real angry and he was raping me.
She said that they're gonna try.
- What do you got?
We are gonna have to name that barstool after you, Ramon.
- Harvey, I think this is a mistake.
- Faster, they're gaining on us.
How much is your boss paying for information?
Right, who's she been talking to?
- Hey, Smiles, have you seen Westfall?
We need to go for it, full speed.
Were we truly this young?
Her son's a sailor.
So, you learn how to sit.
Okay, that's enough. Bye-bye.
Why are you lying around?
- They're bLeanding in.
Let me go get some sedatives.
Powers, energy claws.
How 'bout on the Tallahassee?
Ted just popped by to say hello.
Well, this is unexpected.
We will monitor her overnight.
Fellow citizens, you placed your trust... and hopes in me, and I've betrayed you.
Only one left.
Very common here.
You're not allowed to smoke here, eh?
Or maybe Albany does.
Hey. Hey, is Chris here?
But we have to find out, which is why the next name on the Blacklist is Dr. Krilov.
- If you let me...
And we provoke him, it could blow up in our face.
Take him up to the Cath Lab.
I'm sorry I wasn't a better friend.
- You hold him for a moment?
He's Chechen, fought with the separatists.
Um, yes, we placed a trap door in the State Department's computer system, so if anyone tampers with the manifest, we'll know.
I want you to hug on to each other, keep your heads down.
Like that man stink, huh?
Go on. Get to bed.
Yeah, Mum, it's a boy.
Unsolicited, maybe, but he's listening.
Have a nice chat, Mr. Gerard.
I just hate when people play those kinds of games.
Are you worried about what this woman's gonna think or because you think what we're doing is wrong?
How about you just give me a couple of days to work a little diplomatic magic?
Don't insult the dress. It can hear you.
I just had to turn off the television.
Holly, please. Please don't go.
Your son, your father, your sister...
This is Earth, 66 million years ago.
He's our only hope at finding Pride, stopping Hamilton and saving Clearwater.
I heard about this opening for a pediatric nurse.
What did you do?
All of them!
Let's try something else.
If we lose at trial, you could do ten years.
But the amateur benefits.
You have a green light.
-What was your relationship with her?
Pirosmani all but murdered them himself.
Here he's got this smart...
and everything that's been going on with Annie...
Just be careful.
No way that's just from the heist shooting.
The suspected murderer is the dead woman's husband.
What's the matter?
It's fine. I'm sure I've got her number.
I chose this job.
- No, it mustn't be.
McGee, we can't get there in time.
I need to go back.
Having just met you, that makes the most sense to me.
We are two sorry sons of bitches?
I'm gonna need these.
This is worth millions of dollars. This is motive.
So, you'll just, er... work away, yeah?
Going after Rittenhouse...
In these circumstances, they become two sides of the same coin.
I missed you all.
I started fading. I said a prayer, and, um, loaded up my last bullet and thought that was it.
That baby slid out of Erica with elegance and class just like Dr. Weem did in that Mexican booth.
Can you feel it?
Do you know De Burca Square?
Wait, so you were working with her the whole time?
Did he make it?
Between the two of us, I think I should be more freaked out, since up until four hours ago, I thought you were dead.
How could I push him if I wasn't even touching him?
- Hey, you might have fooled Vera but not me, okay.
April, I got a patient walking into the ambulance entrance.
- So, are we good?
Chapo... Do you know what happens to those who fail me?
Hey, you need to go.
If things go wrong, what happens to Min-woo?
God, I'm so happy that my second first time's gonna be so special.
They've already double-crossed me once today.
I feel good about it.
'We can get convictions here, Maggie, 'if we can re-engage the girls.'
I got a wife, you know.
Okay, challenge them again.
Eat it before your mother finds it, okay?
So we can come up with patriarchal nicknames later.
Here are two rings around the rosie.
- Ooh, snap! Okay, the 6th, you woke up, you had training 7:00 to 9:00. Game tape till 11:00.
Well, that got stupid real fast.
This may be how you do things in Russia...
I should have asked you about Queensland.
- Really? !
He's got Tan with him.
I'm visiting all senior students, letting them know it's business as usual.
- Okay, that's enough.
Got business with one of your clients.
You tell him you know me, he'll set you up.
You're also very hot.
- Louis, can I talk to you for a second?
- We have to figure out what's going on with the new hybrids and we have to find Abigail.
He told me.
Gideon went full Kurtz. He sold his services to Tito Flores.
Or is it just another one of your stories?
The president needs you in the Situation Room.
What do you mean sort of?
No match, no witnesses, no prints, case went cold.
No doing a runner.
Like he was on his way somewhere.
Got a number for you.
Oof. That's always been my dream, man.
And have sex.
You really have a way with women.
I'll get you on with the Marine Bio Response Force.
This is from an hour ago.
I fucked up.
Huh. That can't be right.
Brangelina's eyes flutter open.
Everybody gets together. We're gonna do this different thing this time."
Wear it with pride.
- It's OK. Don't worry.
Does it really need to say that?
I wouldn't buy a used car off you.
Don't you want to keep your eye on the ball?
I will give you and your breasts a little privacy.
I give you my word.
Aw... Or-or gets its head stuck in an empty pickle jar.
Sure you do.
Right around the 4th of July, 2012... that weekend.
She got on a stinking, putrid ship with people-smugglers, she put everything on the line...
Since the senseless murder of Rhys Jones, his family have suffered untold grief and distress.

Make her feel welcome.
Now, they'd chartered the boat for a week to visit some of the smaller islands.
That's how we help each other.
I want Shepherd just as much as you do.
Yeah, yeah, she really is.
You don't have to be French anymore.
You can be sure of that.
Drop your weapons!
Just put the rock down, Jordan.
And you'd tell them that?
That hardly ever happens.
Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you, as well.
Yes, all your men would need to be fed and remain sober, for months.
Make me proud.
I got a hit and run over here at gate b.
- Course you do.
Listen, you got surveillance cameras.
This is for me, okay?
Stop pulling him.
He's getting a call.
You don't have to worry about it, okay?
I have not spent time with her.
There's a reason we haven't talked in years.
Well, I didn't think they were relevant.
He said if raising children were easy, he might've had another.
But in a way, he did. Yes, yes, I guess he did.
I thought if you're not going to give me that, then... grabbing the gun is the next best thing.
I think they set it up that way.
Take it from me, you pull the trigger on this, it's the greatest choice you'll ever make.
Seems like searching this place is a waste of time.
Because the intelligence gathered on that very mission helped prevent what might have been a devastating attack right here in Rome.
- No, I-I'm not with Kaz anymore.
My husband's gone a lot too.
I'm so sorry.
What the hell is vodka luge?
And we have to go.
I don't give a shit where you got 'em.
Turning my bunker into a house of lies.
What, good news?
How would you describe.
We can talk about that when you're down.
An unelected fascist technocrat, accountable to no one, has trampled rights and declared war on this city.
All up in my face. Acting like Mom.

Why can't you start now?
Filthy, dirty copulators.
Thank god you remember me.
I can only guess what you're feeling.
How do you know Chairman Myung-chul Cho?
I have faith that He heard you and He'll spare your sister.
Hey, no, I don't...
As I recall, you had a lovely apartment overlooking it all.
Hey, Anna. It's me.
Is it this?
I want to.
Two-star generals fetch me coffee... Captain.
- No... Just... - Was she asking about us?
Dolls d'amour, shall we say?
Good luck, bro.
Now... tell me the first thought that comes to your mind.
I mean, I put together a cracker jack team to stop a nuke.
You're supposed to be able to open it from the inside, but the latch has been acting up.
It's so sad when someone just gives up.
I made it up to get attention.
You were keeping him abreast of your progress as you searched for the real Walker Elmsley.
And probably received some additional training from a certain three-letter agency.
- I never want back on your desk, Harvey, and I'm here to tell you that your honeymoon as Managing Partner is over.
- It goes no further.
Which you shouldn't be.
Keep the memories alive, that's the thing, isn't it?
I'm going back to my room.
She's exactly your type.
Welcome to New Zealand, Mr Marsh.
I haven't been on this site much.
Tell her we're sorry, but it's cast in stone who we will and will not try to reach.
- It's OK.
And then, I would assume, after you got the diagnosis, that's when you went out and got the life insurance policy.
This is for you.
You're just going to carry on doing what you've been doing for years.
Should there be a conclusion?
You said she found you one some genealogy website?
It's a tale of corporate espionage, where I play the brute enforcer, she's the damsel in distress.
When did you move out your mum and dad's?
If they find him... tell them to kill him.
Is... is she okay?
This is what Bea deserves.

You have two kids.
What's up, man?
You do know if they see us together, we go back inside... for good.
Anyone she might run her mouth to.
You can see he was practicing his shots, trying to get his timing right.
Lost interest, I guess.

Did you mean that?
It was that guy from the bong shop.
He's right, boss.

We just found what we believe to be warehouse space leased by Jaime Bray.
All right, good. Well, I'm late to see Annie.

Was it something I said?
It looks like a lease agreement for warehouse space.
A pedophile cannot separate with his collection.
I haven't heard anything in a while.

So this time next week, you'll be back in London.

We didn't realize it'd kill us.
- All right, just for you.
Oh, look, you can see Raymond's Gulch from here.
You'll be home late.
You'll get the rest of the money when the job's complete.

Gentlemen... let's go hunting.
I'm here to see a mass prehistoric graveyard unlike anything that's been unearthed before.
But can't I stay here?
He's a man.
Owen, I don't know what to do.
It's the tour.
Might help the both of you to get to sleep.
The devil himself came to us and threatened us with doom in one year.
Early morning for you, huh?
Yeah, in the back.
Like, dinosaur tranquilizers?
- Jelly B!
Why won't you go back in there?
Don't be like that, asshole.
This is a first.
He was the one who recommended you.
- Share it with some friends.
Make her suffer.
I know I'll be back to square one there, with no friends, or crew.
It's all over the front page.
Old Raven would've fought back.
- Well, what are you calling me for?
Can we storm out?
- Not for me. I have to buy these sneakers, though.
It's the police.
How could it be anything else?
You figured if Tendu was able to identify you and the agency's owners, other people could, too?
Bobby interviewed her here, and then again and again.
She was like a rosebud that gradually opened.
Let's transfer on my count.
A refuge, an enterprise that specializes in relocating criminals who are on the verge of being arrested or being dispatched by an adversary.
- It was amazing. - It was an absolute moment of glory.
- It's his fault, not mine!
Bangers file the gates loose, use them to hide contraband.
I still can't believe that you're a VP of marketing at a major cosmetics company at 26 years old.
It's like she just... disappeared.
With a short snout.
Fuck you. We'll eat quick.
The master switch is still in the off position.
You know, you should watch your shit around him, sweetheart.
- She was going for a gun!
I drive to the middle of nowhere based on a pack of lies fed to us by a known traitor, who's already betrayed us, like, ten times over.
Why come to this place?
But we can offer something she cannot.
- Is that you?
Thanks to this man.
Franky's right in front of you and she's just a million miles away.
- Your fate is sealed.
Everyone says she's this amazing rider.
We need to go back, think it through, and bring backup.
Give me the goddamn codes, George.
You ruined the operation.
Come on, let's go, people.
Did it fix your deviated septum?
It's curious, don't you think, that the People haven't entered that statement into evidence?
My wife had just died of breast cancer.
Let me know when Mrs Dalton's fully dilated.
Just to be sure.
Patrol found a motorcycle fitting the description of the one the shooter used in that garage.
All humans had it... before the contagion.
Previously on "Salvation"...
Well, sometimes it does a man good to be alone.
- For me? - Yes. Thank you.
Officer Kalakaua. Aloha and salutations.
Come on, we have to go after her.
But here you are, huh?
Unbelievable, isn't she?
- What about now, huh?
Ben, wait for us.
Shouldn't you be partially upright on a "stages of man" chart somewhere?
I'm not so sure.
All I ask is for 24 hours.
So if we can puncture that, it would stop this thing, if it works.
'Cause our lawyer called and said your guy Drew pushed her?
If I find him, I'm going to take him down.
- I smell something nice.
It's a long story.
I'd like to ask you for a personal favor before leaving.
It's not amazing. It's potentially very dangerous.
Well, don't get used to it.
Here's the welcoming committee.
- I'm getting an idea.
So, it's not about lack of resources.
- What did you call me?
But that wears off.
We don't... We don't know, man. You just...
- You do, but I was thinking maybe some of that money - might go to your daughter.
But be subtle about it.
You don't know anything about us.
You're on the run with Lola.
The one Jonjo was found in.
And just as they owe their success to me, they could have me to thank for their downfalls.
And, Mr. Callen.
Now, whatever community panic or press onslaught ensues, we'll just have to handle that.
You heard what Juan said.
- It's a promise.
I am really going to kick your ass.
-and an abandoned kennel. -A kennel?
If those responsible are watching this, they're about to feel the full strength and scope of the Chicago Police Department.
- Hi. He's the lead actor in the film that I'm producing slash co-executive producing.
Rachel! Thank God.
Hey, bad guys, who has a watch on?
We love you.
That, your friendship, everything.
You later planned your moment to retrieve the gun, and as you did you planted some material from Archer's overalls, leaving the bonnet ajar to make sure we'd find it.
- It's really not a big deal.
A really spunky man and an average-looking woman.
I... That's okay. We just wanted to ask you about this.
I do have a right.
'You're not safe.
Did you call her?
You think the easiest route to do, like, in life, like, between being a boxer and then going to college, which one would you choose?
- Is that meant to entice me?
I thought I could rely on you for a sensible answer.
Get you checked out.
ENTRANCE TO WOMEN'S ROOMS PROHIBITED
Now I know it's custom for the staff to call prisoners by their surname, but to me, you'll always be Joan.
Tom and Jerry.
Oh, yes, their second serve has a lot more bite now.
I'm under attack, Dom.
- A little bit, yeah.
You know who else used to boss me about like this?
You never understood what my real ability was, Ron.
We love ya.
What is that? ! It's so fucking stupid!
His ventilator's almost out of juice, so we had to plug it into an outlet.
- Probably best. - Right.
I just want to make sure that you don't go over a ditch or a rock and I end up in a bunch of pieces, okay? You know what it's gonna say on my tombstone?
That alone explains all of Chopper's success.
- Is that what you said? - I did.
Look at the timeline.
I'm worried about my mum and dad.
Stuart, do you want to tell me why my computer crashed again?
Sofia, you tested positive for cocaine.
You're not the dumb one.
Then we slide out.
This guy is preying on our most vulnerable citizens.
DIE NOW, YOU MURDERER!
In the interviews you did for Moving Targets, you said that if you won, you were planning on giving the million dollars to charity?
- No, yes.
A stun gun.
Your friend, he insults me.
Cabe can shoot it down. No.
It's been months of trying during the fertile window of her cycle.
I won't sit here defending myself for doing my job.
Okay, look. We should be all right.
That's not how it works.
- So? - Well, so?
He called Steve Tully... and fired him.
Prince William was 15 years old when his mother died.
Looking forward to another day at school.
She decided not to come with us.
Her name is Zoe.
I fuckin' won it 12.
A woman walking her dog nearby said she heard a man shout, "et disperdam illud""
I'm sorry, Joan.
Well, now you finally get it.
Yes, but who is the public going to believe?
Can you get some water for this one?
Would that I could, man, but he's one of the best photojournalists around, and pictures matter.
I have got a phone full of photos of you guys all cozy'd up at the burger joint.
I love it.
Goodbye, my darling.
We'll find her.
- Whoa. - Hi.
Do you want me to call Vera, eh?
There was a book in your room.
I'd say at least 30 days.
No, I think I saw you give him something under the table.
Places in Midtown.
I can't wear this when I meet them.
You can still visit Bone Town for sure, nice day trip, little vacay, pop in, buy a trinket, but not until you get this love business squared away.
Can I get you anything, or...
Oh, good idea, Zoe.
Yeah, but I didn't think I'd get it.
You think perhaps he was killed by someone he outbid.
A successful sting based on intercepted and properly decoded SBK messages?
♪ You think that I don't feel love ♪
So maybe this unsub sees himself as a God, and these victims represent nations and kingdoms to punish.
Why are you still here?
Someday soon, that will work in your favor.
It just gets worse.
But maybe it's better for all of us if we just let that go.
I saw his mother today, she's gaga.
How do I look?
- He'll come around.
Guy's name is Darren Azoff.
We called for backup.
We hit 100,000 views, we'll light him up like a Christmas tree.
Well, yeah, sure, but... seems strange that he would wade into a national security case.
And one of you has the audacity to think I'd fall for a spoofed IP address.
Oh, what's that song that you're always singing?
Isn't that all that matters?
To attend a friend's funeral.
What are you doing?
The Blue Cat alone is not gonna cut it.
Yet, you procured poison.
- That's not what your roommate says.
I know what Tench needs to hear.
Yeah. I hope he's a good designer because he's a terrible poker player.
Go on. Water's good for you.
- Come on, why not?
No, I mean, I'm glad that I know.
Graham Dillamore was a young gardener when he began working for Diana.
What did you say? What did you say to me?
Not sure how long it'll hold it.
I was probably a 12- or 13-year-old boy who had posters of them on his wall.
I doubt you just heard. But I did just hear from the Chinese president about it.
Go to hell!
What if the Ghost Pony zapped her?
Please, please, don't let him die.
Sorry about the mess.
Are you there?"
[softly] I do. -We've got to tell somebody. -He will kill us.
I mean, I don't know, I mean, this is it's a lot for a girl to process.
He saved a dog?
- Madam Vice President.
So, what is wrong with America today?
Now's the time when we need it most.
That's the thing. He won't come in.
You're the new one?
My aunt, she's got this amazing garden with a pool, and there's parrots in the trees.
The evidence was wrong!
"A branch from Groot.
Why on earth would she do this?
Out of the kitchen and into the world.
You will not be accompanying me?
Got a bit defensive, didn't he?
I thought he was working with her.
Daddy got it for me from Paris.
You taking any fire?
It's the same with you.
You know, for a tough guy, you sure do get emotional easy.
It's his tongue.
You're gonna find out Who's using our account for flowers, okay?
When we were at your house, you told me some information. I wanted to ask you about it again.
I don't know.
Paula says yous have an idea who did this to Callum?
Yeah, well, could have fooled me.
I don't get the reference.
Oh, that's nice.
All right, what did you see?
When I read that letter, I just got so excited.
Assume you've been made.
Why did you keep running?
- Go back to bed.
And Rachel and I took care of it.
But I've never had it.
Niall Swift's phone records...
And what is that supposed to mean?
What a nice surprise.
30 seconds until I get to the exit.
Let's face it, in this scenario, the humans are the invaders.
It's all over.
That's a new one on me.
Hey, Perry! No!
Mercer's already been stopped and searched 80 times by us... 80 but I've looked at this Moody kid and in my opinion, he comes from a decent family.
I didn't mean to say that out loud.
She tried to take care of it before you got back.
Don't tell me.
Yeah, I'm sorry, brother.
Well, he's probably afraid we'd hang it on Bonzi, flip him on the gang, but now he's got another problem.
A lot of good people worked hard to bring it back.
You know, Tim, there's no obligation here.
All of them.
They'll go, "Maybe you were abused,"
Make it look like one's driving.
No matter how much we want Isaac back, we cannot betray Mitch and Clem.
I see myself leaving the room and I wonder if they just sat and laughed.
And that's his job and there's no getting around that.
Synced by PetaG and nkate
However, I do regret what happened to Mr. Mizuguchi.
It's okay, all right?
That didn't sound right, did it?
I reckon you would be one of His favourites.
I mean, I think he could definitely benefit from therapy, but... I'm not ruling out those meds.
This side gets worse every day.
If I'm walking down a dark alley and I start to feel afraid, that's my body trying to protect me from gang boys with knives.
Doyle, I've looked into Ferguson's phone calls,
People on the street.
I... I ran around the yard and, and...
How do you think?
Me ma... me ma was in a... hospital.
Min-woo must think you're dead by now.
Here comes the boob.
I bet you can't wait to get out of this place, hey?
You're not answering your phone.
But I don't know. I swear.
Did you hear that?
Poland is not france.
You maybe have a little bit less hair.
I don't believe this.
You mean you really like her.
These marks, this is where we marked Hope's height every six months. Till she was 18.
You two like each other.
Well, that's stupid because we haven't done anything.
EPISODE 4 CHOICES
Just... just know how sorry I am for hurting you... and for hurting T.C. with all my crap.
How many girls are you listening to right now?
You're at it every day, aren't you?
I mean, although I'm not a big fan, I'm very happy for you, Supergirl.
I gotta know. What's gonna happen with my hand?
- Just fuckin' listen up, all right?
Okay, Cabe and Walter, get Toby ready, and I'll handle Happy.
This is an administration that operates behind closed doors, out of the public eye.
Clearly in high school.
Everybody liked it.
Are you ready to tell me why the police suspected you?
He opened the safe, took out the gun and one bullet, then walked out into the middle of the cricket square.
Julian just made me medical director of the E.R. and head of the new cardiac surgical center.
He needs me to sell our collaboration to an investor.
We've already lost so many men.
- Don't mind your fucking earrings!
You didn't pat him down? You didn't search him?
I was the one who told them about Natasha.
All right, get the names of the women at the birthday party.
You've almost finished your new novel?
Could you get it analyzed?
No. You-you did nothing wrong.
- So peaceful in here
We'll get you out of here.
You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping...
A bit, yeah.
- I wouldn't lie about that.
Kelsey's not much older than some of your students.
My sister Joyce and Sister Cathy.
Since he repeatedly stabbed two of the victims, as well as killed a police officer, he was considered...
All the best plans feel like that, Rog.
Look, I know what you're thinking.
Guerrero wants to change the law, he can run for office.
We're not mates, or anything.
I'm defending the flock.
- Good work.
'Cause it really doesn't sound like it.
We went in. Uh-huh.
Mandy, I have to know, only for me, but I need to know, is there anything you can tell me about Patty?
So be careful.
I'm starving, man.
He was gay.
You're married to one of them.
I just need a couple of days
It can't be this easy.
Six months ago, I started living under the same roof with five women.
- Who was she?
It was nice to get away, right?
This is a phone call, not moments ago, with Russian intelligence operatives striking a deal with our president.
And now you know.
If we go in there, we're both screwed.
I tried to do the right thing and I turned myself in, 'cause I believe that I should pay a price for what happened.
This really is one of the most impressive science laboratories I've ever seen.
He misses you.
I'm not going anywhere without David.
Probably on his...
But I'm guessing you didn't expect we'd be looking into our missing day.
You got some nerve using that word.
Since his promotion he does.
You know that.
Get me out of here!
I'm roughly right, aren't I?
And what would you know about love anyway?
- Dinner? - I have to stay at work.
The cops can't find him.
She's ready for her bottle.
- What do we know, Dave?
And I was just hours away from a trip to Mexico.
Both cars were found abandoned with no apparent signs of struggle, keys were still in the ignition, and both girls had went shopping."
It's Señor Bianco.
I want to do something impossible.
Hey, Neil, I'm having a little end-of-summer soirée at my country home up north later today.
Are you sure?
And putting this tourist in the arena is gonna help?
I don't even understand it myself.
If only we had left together...
And that they included a woman who said she had witnessed the body of the dead nun.
You're his friend, right?
I would've given it to the horse, but that's another way to go.
You found the newspaper.
At the time, she wanted to get away from me. Ha!
- Mm-hmm. - Thanks, Abby.
We need to take him out.
Must've have left it on the truck.
Are you okay?
And even though you don't trust me, I am the only one you can trust.
Cover for us.
When he saw who it was, he let her go.
Yeah, I think I have a lighter.
She has beautiful features.
! Who is this guy?
- Mail for you Jackson...
Have you been dealing drugs in this prison, Mr Stewart?
They said we can stay off as long as we need.
That's why this is happening.
Can I ask you...
- No. Harry and the Hendersons.
They said she told them she was going straight home, but you think she lied, ditched them and went out dancing?
There's no way he'll give evidence against Mercer unless he gets a Section 71, full immunity.
- What about it?
Wanna see Gramps have his plaster taken off?
Was that a different beast?
I'm rolling out there now.
It won't survive if it doesn't get a blood transfusion - in the next three days.
It'd be a shame to waste practice lessons.
But I'm sending you to...
And just the one thing I'll never ever forget, when they pulled the sheet back, her face was all dirty and muddy, and... her hair had sticks in it.
- You're alive?
But I realize now it's m-maybe kind of the opposite.
Did he get you hooked on it?
Thank you for so succinctly answering my question, Daphne.
For what, Corey?
And create thrust, I know.
There's a problem in Rochdale, with kids, with really vulnerable kids, being groomed for sex by much older men.
- Well, it doesn't matter when it is.
- Let's go, Toño, come on!
Should we help him?
- Oh, Jesus!
What do you think?
No, you don't bring a man like that in to chat.
I'd be a terrible drug dealer.
I got a lot of menu jokes, but that's my favorite.
She is a snake in the grass!
I spoke with Rebecca Hedrick, um, and Rebecca Kaplan from It's On Us, and, you know, what I learned was... [stammers] I kind of had a bit of an insight into what people go through
I thought it was just a really informative trailer.
Look at that bead.
Give me the bag!
You make me angry!
I'm not letting him go again.
Um, whatever you said to Franky, you need to take it back.
They're all fuckin' dead!
- Like what?
Yeah, but he just puts too much stock in everything she says.
You think I'm imagining things?
Oh, it proves enough.
You're blackmailing me.
By putting them on the indictment.
How do I manage that?
He's become the most popular superhero in the whole world.
No exigent circumstances, that's what the phone guy's gonna say.
I used to have an imaginary friend.
That girl is lying.
Why is your experience public?
And was never... seen... again!
It was on my bucket list.
It wasn't in the file.
It needs me.
But without those pills...
I don't understand.
I don't think he liked the look of me.
As you say, anything to stop the fighting.
- Previously on The Last Man on Earth...
I was drugged.
Mm. The women want their top dog back.
But, you could be a great one.
But the truly incredible thing about this asteroid strike was that it changed the face of our planet within seconds.
Why did they take me?
I don't want her to be cold, I want her to be a comfortable temperature.
I'm joking. I'm just kidding you.
You know a good Governor protects her staff.
Calls have been made.
No internet for inmates.
We're lucky that grenade wasn't inside me.
- Yeah, I'm fine.
He sure is.
"Yep, you smashed me good.
He's offering to give up the load.
She all right?
Have you over. - (Chuckles) Okay.
Why, they only run Wonka's entire candy operation.
It's pretty pathetic, if you ask me.
I don't care what they're saying.
We know nothing of the kind.
You, my friend, just seem smug and arrogant.
You died thinking that you were leaving her in a world full of hope, but that's not what happened.
Prepare for transport to Big Show City jail.
So you're going to do the surgery?
Gemma Hoskins... bulldog.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Navy Coalition Fight Night here in beautiful New Orleans.
Grace, I want Darius to succeed.
Because you're a selfish person who doesn't care about anyone but you expect everyone to care about you!
Brass thought she'd be safer off base.
We can use the lining of his abdomen to filter his blood.
I forgot something. I'll meet you out there.
- It's the way you sit in a saddle.
The Great Glass Wonkavator.
You knew about the baby swap, and you covered it up.
Do you get back often?
Guy's holding a residency spot over our heads with this.
Thanks to the involvement of these five women, my life will change a lot.
- I would like to... Only...
We got a bona fide homicide.
You'll fit right in here.
Because you guys shouldn't have to do that type of mission.
No, but she acted like it.-
Yeah. It's a wonderful quality.
I'm so happy for you!
- Yeah? - Dessie, you ready?
Look, what I was trying to say earlier is that I'm sorry for, you know...
He was violent.
-I don't know.
Sentenced to 10 years at FCI Petersburg.
Lights to 20%, please.
I'm sorry, Coach Tannen.
'Cause, obviously, this wouldn't have happened without it.
This should do the trick.
No. Pin forgot to mend the gate.
Scott and I are gonna be up in a couple of minutes.
So how did Hall know?
Heard from your mum?
All right, check it out, check it out, check it out.
- It's okay, it's okay...
No wonder the middle class is so angry.
- Excuse me?
Will you marry me?
Still tracking it.
Because I knew you wouldn't be sophisticated enough to get it.
He just vanished, and...
I was drunk.
Ma'am, you done did a terrible thing to me.
You didn't invite us. We made this plan ourselves ten years ago.
As you can see, Madam Secretary, our nation has a rich history.
Was it a man, a woman, trans?
Time for a smoko, Brenda.
Do you want to give me a hand?
You and I both know he's not the same person now, just like I'm not the same person.
It's definitely a girl, coming in at six and half pounds.
The police are investigating the motive for the murders.
The Wi-Fi's spotty. Yeah, that's plenty wilderness for me.
I am afraid they will realize...
Come on. I got you.
Come on, up, up, up.
I wonder what happened to him.
Did you kill him?
You don't put enough jam on this.
You take a picture with your photographic memory, and then I'll take a cyanide pill.
But what am I supposed to do when I find my goat laying on its side in the field, fucked within an inch of its life and a naked man with blood and straw all over his peck?
And I'm sorry.
Uh, no, we just need to...
Camila, thank you so much for coming in the office.
Let me go.
Will there be more?
And I studied up to third grade.
All right, we got this.
I'm not gonna ask again.
- After five?
Well, maybe it will be me.
I wouldn't have fallen in love with you if you weren't.
Uh... I don't want to.
I hope you have.
It's always been you and Sam, and...
I didn't expect the old dog to pack a punch like that.
I mean, that's a less nuanced version of it but, yeah.
I'd have to get him into autopsy, but there was one thing peculiar.
All righty, Anne, why don't you scream something else?
And I-I like you.
You can see there's language that shows both parties agree that his book will be published under the pseudonym. Walker Elmsley.
You wouldn't act like such a big shot then.
She knew that her research would ruffle feathers.
You can handle the rest, Patton?
Ah, the prison grapevine.
Would Dr Kildare give up that easily?
Eh. I'd hold off.
Just tell Mia he's not ready.
Bit of a stuff-up last night, hey?
She was someone who at an incredibly young age would put her passion behind something that she genuinely believed in.
That's the dumbest thing you've ever said!
After you, ladies.
It's a concealed placental abruption.
Unlock me. Unlock me.
You didn't need to.
Let her go!
And I kept going.
How's it looking?
But it was also an utterly unique experience.
Guthred, I gave you my word, my sword.
And I seen them come up the path.
It's probably the same body.
The rule is... nobody dies in my novels.
One for the sample and one to balance the centrifuge.
Your beard is gone.
Whatever's about to happen here... will happen to you, too.
And if I knew, I would tell you.
What if Mr. Asad won't withdraw his complaint?
Yeah, but then you put it...
It had been on there for months, and he didn't use it to just delete things.
Does it matter who?
So, the super hero girls came back to the arena?
Chelsea, why don't you go and sit down?
Hey, J.J., what did you do with all that footage you shot last week?
You know, you can really go wild trying to find out different things.
Yeah. Let's meet in the morning so we can make a day of it.
He was supposed to bring it back.
But if I wanted to shoot you, wouldn't it be more like this?
Who are you?
You were smart to come back here and hide, but not smart enough.
'They've agreed to a news embargo till the new year.'
-Listen to me. Listen.
Yeah, Dessie Toner is a weird and lonely kid.
I mean, you can't do anything about your skin tone yet, but an aloha shirt and some shades might go a long way.
Hank, she said, "There's something bigger going on here." She wouldn't say what.
Make copies, and send them to defense counsel.
- It's true.
Erica, hon. Erica?
Listen, tell her to take as long as she needs.
I have to see my children.
You manage to see through all this.
- What is that?
Dated this stewardess, she told me she was on the pill.
And we're trapped.
HAPPY FAMILY ORPHANAGE
That magazine cover is in the bag.
I didn't mean to throw the Frisbee in the water, and I'm sorry about the incident on the beach.
My partner's trying to stabilize him in the rear of the aircraft.
But listen, if you want...
Get out of the field!
Great, but where would we find enough honey to submerge her?
- I didn't tell her.
Try the one on the top shelf.
This is huge.
There will be a parade soon at the main square.
You'd better believe it!
Some of us believe that we could do anything.
It doesn't matter.
No castle... nothing there.
If yo care about the safety of your child, tell me what you know.
Yeah, we need it for electrophoresis.
Could your dad have forgotten to write some of the bookings down?
- No, sir. - No one else killed your mom?
And make things worse?
I will read it over carefully.
So, did you guys find anything out today?

That barn is about as haunted as my saddle pad.
- Who do you think...
I can't kick her out with a kid and everything.
No, no, no, you can't can cut me open.
Thieves use braids to mark horses they're planning to steal.
So now that you're back...
It looks like it was foreclosed on a couple months ago.
And instead of saying, "Yeah, I have your back in all situations, unless you do something legitimately sketchy,"
Sonja did wrong. I get that.
Give it to me and put out the cigarette.
I'm Hope Norwich.
Baby, when I give my patients bad news, I deliver it as directly and dispassionately as I can.
Of course, they will make outrageous demands.
We're in a bit of a race against time now.
Once this is on its maiden voyage, we can find help, and then I can spend the rest of my life rubbing O'Brien's smug nose it in.
You're coming with us.
I'm blinded by sweetness!
Shut down nearly a decade ago.
Looks like a race.
This is the deal.
The crematorium workers all have alibis, and we couldn't find anybody who works in the area who saw anything suspicious.
This totally explains it!
I can make thousands of the portable rations like the kind Killy had.
First round, I'm just gonna let him chase me.
The war between you guys is making the government nervous.
Well, where is she?

Has he said anything at all?
Sorry, Scotty, I'm just tired and grumpy.

How about looking the other way for a six-year Bureau vet?
I'll drive around, see if I can find him.

I need a medical team.
He's a great kid.
Huh? That's weird.
Not so much for the 18.
He had been very quiet.
Dwayne, I'm gonna bleed to death unless you get me to a doctor.
I thought you were in that wish realm with Robin.
Th-that can't be a coincidence.
Definitely was a man.
No, no, no, let me do this.
Well, if you're worried about Epifanio,
Are you serious?
So whenever you're worried, scared, anxious, whatever, I don't care, you call that phone, and I'm gonna answer.
He's right here, in the house.
What he needs is some tough love.
What's the catch? She's been sequestered by the Sardovian government ahead of the International Chess Championship, which starts tomorrow.
That guy from downstairs, he knew about the gun.
Oh, you have to say that, you're sweet on me.
Don't worry, we're keeping an eye on him.

Can you excuse me? I need to make a call.

All the things I've given you.
Was it a birthstone for the bride?
I gave her a dollar, but she wanted more.
- Fuck knows what he'll do to me!
Hetty of Troy.
In my mind he has a blind spot, and I will say that with all due deference when you're criticizing somebody who's that powerful.
See you upstairs.
You check the yard, I'll check the corridor and I'll meet ya at lunch.
That's a bit old to run away.
This was supposed to be a celebration.
- You're so full of shit.
And the sad thing is I know you would have done a better job.
Oh, I'm also gonna need you all to sign standard nondisclosure agreements. I can't let anyone know the details of my work until I report my findings to NASA.
These are the pages that I'm gonna need if anything goes wonky.
Let's head back to pony camp. We'll be just in time for the barbecue.
You have a particular set of skills, don't you?
- But if one of the first things I did ends up giving Bratton a roadmap to picking this firm apart, I will never forgive myself.
Please don't tell my family.
We're pretty close friends.
A third party's involved.
A pun too far, Becky. A pun too far.
Happy, Cabe, we'll also need a small hollow log. For what?
Had the lab rush the test on our gun.
That's what I thought.
- What's it do?
So, it's really just waiting for the dust to settle. That's all.
Yeah. An old friend from an old life.
My parents were good Catholic parents.
How many weeks in Seattle, and you've already got an admirer.
The nurses said she was too unstable this morning, so they put her back on sedation.
If you ever need something,
"Today I'm going to kill someone"?
This is it!
There is no out, Jake.
Oh, look, I know the puddings are good, but there must be more that you all desire.
We didn't know you were American.
- It wasn't me.
And what if they can't?
You don't know me but I'm Alan's girlfriend.
You can stay if you want, but I can zoom in with the car.
Ah, there it is.
Hey, uh, so I've been thinking about it and I want to take the job.
- What are you going to do?
Then, have you ever been deeply in love?
Because in the end, it wasn't the size of the asteroid... the scale of the blast, or even its global reach that made dinosaurs extinct.
Wait, I say, on the Lord.
- Ooh. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Tell me. Tell me.
You admit to shoving your fully loaded service weapon down the victim's throat?
You left out the part where you went to Richie Dowd's house the day after Jo Jo's pictures showed up online.
I said, "Thank you, sir," and shook his hand.
- Okay, Mercado, that'll do!
If this potion clears up the darkness, you and Charming will be able to make us all retch with your sweet nothings in no time.
I look good in that.

Something dangerous... and fun... and fun!
Even with double vision.
Gentlemen, ladies of the board.
She's five years older than your daughter.
She said she's always wanted to meet the great Rebecca Sherman.

I am. Yeah, inquiring minds want to know.
You're gonna have to pack up your tent and go somewhere else.
That's why Triple P is on the case.
But you enslaved us!
Until now, I didn't know who sent the invitations or what their objective was.
From the 201-plus pound weight division, by TKO, Mr. Cam F. Awesome!
But Reid was able to convince her to surrender by telling here he would take her to see her father.
He's been kidnapped?
No, I'm serious. She ended things with me.
Principal Waller would have totally caught that in their application.
If they haven't changed the terrain, I think I can get back there again.
But it's the quality of those interviews that's going to make or break our case with the CPS.
Be my girl.
Will... if you could just give us a moment, please.
I've already put together a system for portraying Mr. Hanaki's world.
There are deals in place.
What's the matter?

It's all right.
They create bright stains, but they're still easy to wash off skin and clothes.
We gotta get to that tracking system, which is located in the top of this missile.
Thanks for everything, Miss Bennett.
- James... - I don't want to hear about him!
I know you tried your best, but I'm taking over.
- Ray's dead.
The last thing I need is LA.
That's just the heartbeat.
All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is And we can find a quiet path to the crib.
I've been to the opera, Neil.
To be doing all that alone, and fighting a spiteful husband in court, you need help.
I've already almost died twice this year.
Erm, about quarter-past-eight.
Oh, people do much worse than that.
We have to go.
DSV SEC is a kind of bank code.
- Do you understand?
Each just shy of 10 grand.
Pathetic little underling.
It's just my way of saying thank you.
And it would be very uncool if you didn't show up.
Original... That it was like magazines or some things were...
- I brought this.
And that concludes this morning's tour.
Oh, think about all the times that she's helped us.
I'm here to tell you you're backing the hell off my firm.
No draw there, I'll tell you that.
Mom, why isn't the Wi-Fi working?
Don't you get tired of it all?
Lucky for both of you, my keen detective skills tell me that the center of the building is straight ahead.
Wouldn't it be better if you wrote your diary like that?
You kissed him.
I just assumed we were in Dallas... or Houston.
We got creative as hell.
My mom was very devout.
Need you to drive up to the Wildlife Center.
Just because he doesn't remember now, doesn't mean he'll stay that way.
No car, no trash.
Anyway, get me those diamonds and bring them back here.

Who are you working for?
- You're welcome.
- Hey. Raven!
I gotta go.

Father Maskell's dead in the coffin.
Come over and apologize.
- Hey, Gary, what's in this salad?
So does your mom know that you know?
And sometimes, it's a big crazy love.
- What did you say?
It's making fizzy lifting drinks.
It's been a whole day!
And thank you for what you said to the Ombudsman.
And what are you doing, having sex with a married woman anyway, you know?
You know this, I've probably mentioned it in my sleep.
Talk to me.
What time do you have?
H-H-How... I mean, how did she show up with my blood on her?
- It's a vision.
- That was it.
And I dipped them in the ashes in the fireplace and made tracks going to the tree with the presents and back to the fireplace, like Santa tracked ash all over the floor.
Are you there?
Subtitle sync and corrections by awaqeded for
I-Is there something I'm supposed to do?
So, we found a lawyer, Steve Tully, and the church was paying his fee, and so, it was a mutual...
- It never stops, does it?
You didn't think we'd let you go just like that? What happened to you there?
What happened to withdrawing from the battlefield?
- I can't say.
It must be some sort of jamming software.
Allie was moving.
- Ed, forget about her.
I want to know where the amethyst you stole yesterday is and I want to know now.
I'm a fuck-up!
Is there something wrong?
- I was just telling Oliver that if you get sick of seeing me around here, then he's gonna have to tell you too bad, 'cause I am not gonna let the Brooklyn Housing Project keep bullying its tenants.
Take a seat, please.
- I said no, okay?
Okay, it's gonna be that kind of day.
Why didn't you ask first?
I'll take that fuckin' risk.
There's an outstanding order of extradition against you to be returned to Spain for retrial.
You may think that you can stop me, but that doesn't mean the final battle is over.
The baby's father.
Yeah, I get it.
There's always one thing you can do from inside a computer, even if you're a jumped up little subroutine, you can do it.
We're headed to the Review Board.
Technically, those aren't even digits...
To The Warlock's Chest.
I got nothing. I'm saving my singles for Felix's pole-lates.
Believe me, that is the last you'll hear about it.
It's a complete replica of our office.
- I should've noticed them.
The fire started in the kitchen. There's a conference in the ballroom,
You alright? Yeah, you? This is going to be sick!
Everything smells like death.
I was hoping that you'd quit.
Yeah, that's one. One picnic.
What? Climb over!
It was a coordinated attack, starting with the tunnels.
- Look at you.
Whether it's today or tomorrow or 10 years from now, that's when you open the box.
Any other detail that comes to mind? - No.
From that to that, seamlessly.
Oh, ma'am. I-I'm so sorry I was late.
Don't let this get between you two.
- I know so.
Put a name to that heart, and I believe it'll lead us straight to the killer.
It was so much fun.
No, no, no, no, no. I got all the sugar I need right here.
-It's about him, isn't it?
They wanted to kill Mark?
May I ask you one question?
- Yeah, well, that's the thing, Suze.
It makes our family seem relatively normal.
They're jerking us around.
I'd like to believe that.
She passed because, technically, she should pass.
A big one.
At least, that's the closest I've ever gotten.
Yeah, well, I got a kid who's sitting alone in a meat freezer, and Cabe and Paige have broken hearts, so what would you prescribe, Doc?
I knew what I was getting into, and he's right.
You think Frank Dowd's ready to talk?
Must be quite a... shock to the system.
George, why do you have empty hands?
Shit. Have you told your mum what happened?
And we don't know what kind of hostiles to expect.
- Right. Jesus, I can't believe I'm fucking saying all this.
I'm in the bathroom.
So, this is where Sister Cathy lived and my Uncle Bill was right here.
I was like, "What happened?"
We were going through...
Yeah, I know, I know.
What kind of professional?
After Cosimo returned the following night and I accepted.
Let's talk. Just don't do that.
Well, at least the cameras like him.
Or I could have the Bureau file a missing-persons report, have all sorts of people looking for him.
We can have fun and I can get some work done.
Well... I would like to arrange a secret dinner with the actress Nanaka Hiraki and Mr. Hanaki.
Time to go, Conway.
Yeah, well, she never forgave you for using pre-made pastry.
Because it's not exactly kosher.
That's all we wanted.
You're giving me my, uh, motorcycle back?
Yeah, new people or patients ask, "What's this 'Topher's Corner'?" And we can say, "Let me tell you a little something about Topher."
It would still be your surgery.
- The crew?
I mean, people keep things bottled up, and then something sets them off, and some poor shit takes the brunt of it.
- It's not him.
And finds peace there.
Okay, so the CIA is aware of Belanov.
A crib, man!
- and isolated.
We are officially neutral on this issue.
I am beyond excited.
But I want you to go now.
Can I ask you something?
All through elementary school, the majority of the nuns that taught you were older.
D.A. Gibson's assistant, Wilson.
He said he needed my help.
I can get whatever I want without having to compromise myself, and if you couldn't, then you weren't a very good operative.
I'll walk Proctor back.
- No, come in.
Follow his horse's footprints, stuff like that?
It's spontaneous clonus from serotonin syndrome.
But Kannell got the message first?
Just such incredible, amazing forces at work here.
Your case has been dropped.
Like you should be, Abby.
He had his reasons.
You know it?
Look what happens.
I don't think you can get one without the other.
I know what happened.
No crime against cleanliness, Inspector, as far as I'm aware.
- The woman gave us extra! - Come on.
Well, get in line.
I don't know.
Handy with electronics, too.
- Dee Dee?
'Cause, I mean, sure, yeah, you know, yes,
Yes. Uh, Hetty wants Deeks to back up Sam.
- Need a favour.
With the money, her and Ed can stay together.
You want to go back to my place?
'Cause the last thing either of us want right now are more hostages, right?
Judge Baird doesn't usually order those.
Well, I guess there... wasn't a whole lot to look forward to.
And keep in mind, you promised not to use the name Bezequeel.
Abby, we're gonna do our best.
And I can assure you it's not legal either, but it's an opportunity we can't afford to pass up: to not only apprehend a fugitive, but also to save a girl and quite frankly, sir, to save your presidency, too.
Eddie Szymanski does all the hiring.
Keep your hands where I can see them!
Then I guess we're going to Mexico.
Need to know where they are now.
- You okay?
You're going to give me everything we need to exonerate him.
In my experience at the DEA, the moment these drug lords start believing in their own power is the moment for them and all their allies to fall.
General, I'll remind you that Mr. Bray is a Colombian citizen.
And they tell me the Debt Collector is coming for you, which means he's the next Blacklister.
So sorry I didn't call before...
You must see a doctor.
I won't take up too much of your time.
Instead, they're looking for his killer.
What? A-A-Are you sure?
- I don't bite.
And I think that's where the blood came from.
You warm enough?
- You know, I thought of leaving Pearson Hardman
Jesus fucking Christ!
Talk to Boden.
-What do you mean, not possible?
I tend to speak more matter-of-factly.
Hopefully to better news.
I don't know.
She's more LA than a wannabe actor sipping on kale juice.
And, wait, Mr. Scratch's involvement was...
- What about Evie? - What?
- Go grab your things.
It's proof you have talent, Shin Michima!
You talked to Julia?
What happened? She doesn't remember.
You know what, sis?
You've been conspiring with Detective Trench Coat since he got here.
And that's the good news.
[chuckles] To my new partner.
Alvez, Lewis, take the back.
The evacuation forced open the exterior doors and left us vulnerable to incoming threats.
Hang in there, Salazar.
- So Lindbergh's alive?
At that altitude?
Leah just finished a round of chemo.

But... the impact will also create a storm of smaller meteors headed directly for Earth.
With a horse.
No, it must have just gone bad.
So, when exactly did this happen?
Politicians, celebrities, judges.
Yeah, you too.
The boy appeared out of nowhere;
Just let me go to sleep.
Well, mostly anyway.
On the ground.
Okay, so I suggest that we move to higher ground where we'll build our device.
You're gonna bring back the happy endings.
- Hmm. - We'll harvest foetal stem cells and begin processing a treatment for you immediately.
I say so because I know this office has bad habits.
don't get hot and do anything stupid with that thing.
- Coming in! - Okay!
I'm sorry about this whole ambush thing.
- Don't, please! Come on.
Four, five, Victor, Boy, Sam, six, seven.
We have an approaching!
Why am I going to New Zealand?
Well, I really only have one friend.
Wait a minute.
He's got his private stash, the good stuff that's just for him.
- Ten percent of my half of the company is five percent.
Or is that what you want?
What's wrong with a cat called Cat?
Yes, she talks loud.
Just follow me below deck; I'll bring you to your cargo.
I don't give a shit!
And can you find more?
- He took me inside.
I can't right now. My mother...
How you doing?
If someone watching this is feeling like their life doesn't have worth, I hope that you see around Hannah in this show all the people who care about her, and know that there are those people in your life as well.
No, I'm not. I'm just gangly.
I just want Maxie to be here with me.
Why would you ever do that?
Any idea what a small-town New Jersey police chief is doing running around New York with a paintball gun?
But it can't be here.
Hell if I give him any publicity.

Hell of a job, Drew. You never quit.
I wanna see the full destruction in 3-D.
Well, I'm sure it won't be awkward when we run into each other at the chocolate fountain.
Isn't that going to hurt your neck?
I think so.
I understand why you want the world to hear your story.
So if we say no, what are you, gonna betray Reddington?
They had some help.
- No, no, no.
Nothing compared to how I'm feeling.
You have a heart as soft as a baby bird.
Lucía, please, telephone the owner of the El Global newspaper.
-That's not me.
We think that they left this behind.
It's cool. "It's cool."
I think... Julia has too much influence over Sam.
Graft is in place.
You think there's any way I'm letting you get near her?
I feel sad, too.
Maybe there's an underlying condition not related to the accident that we don't know about.
Aren't you tired of running, Lola?
I appreciate the warning, Helen. Thank you.
Did you guys see Invasion of the Body Snatchers? No.
I might be able to help you there.
When did the two meet?
Harvey, I told you, that was a one-time thing.
- Well played? - Well played?
- Her and some other preggo.
Why would she do that?
- How? I... Thank God.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Madam Secretary.
Jesus Christ, another murder.
Lieberman agreed to meet her at these coordinates.

Midori Suzumura, age 17.
We'd better get you back.
Mm-hmm. Sounds like a field trip to me.
Reddington's hidden protector.
I'm in a hurry.
There's no take-backs.
We have flexible scheduling.
What are you doing here?
You think about it.
There weren't one.
- Do you know him?
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
Hurry the fuck up.
- Yeah. What a shitty totem pole.
This time, it will.
Man, she's a trip wire.
Any one of them could have stood up and said,
Folks everywhere will know your name.
Everything else you've said, anything to do with this beating or Roy's murder, is pure speculation.
I had no other choice.
What? No way. Raven will never go for it.
I didn't even know he had an electric toothbrush.

You want my help, hmm?
So, I'm here in the hope that you might have some relevant intelligence in relation to them.
- Well, one of my favorites...
- Whoa, you think this is Todd's? - No way.
It was so easy to crack.
What kind of crazy compound is my son working on now?
Well, maybe he should.

Plus, I, I think I'm setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on.
Are you saying that the crash wasn't about the profit, but about the system itself?
- Come here, Cora.
Other kids thought she was in control.

Molina said to monitor Pena.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I hear Joan Millar's been discharged already.

It's something I'm feeling inside.
Beat his ass good.
I guess it's less catchy.
I'm not 25 anymore.
- Do I look all right?
Hey, Jade, just in time.
Well, I'm afraid it is. Your story book.
We only have so long before me working on this becomes too risky, which means this is the only way.
She's on her way here now thinking she's going to save me.
- Unless Georges de La Tour painted a second Repentant Magdalen... and he didn't... this one had to be fake.
Look, I can't tell you anything right now, Boomer,
- Everything's okay, and it wasn't an intense discussion.
Charlene, if you were in trouble, why didn't you call me?
That is a total breach of our trust as friends.

He's perfectly fine.
Bring it in.
There's a loose thread there.
Raymond has left me no choice.
Sort it out as soon as we get back.
Let's put it this way. You might as well be.
I have no clue how he runs things.
Couldn't you consider the feelings of the people you killed?
You're trying to measure the frequency.
- All right.
Things are going so well with Brian, {\pos(192,210)}and Zack seems totally cool with it.

And how do you handle a responsibility like that?
No, I came for an apology.
Thank you man, so much.
I'm with you, man.
And what was up in the lab with you yesterday?
Time's up on my offer.
I did way worse shit than you.

How do villains always figure out this weird junk?
Just face it, Blake...
He's just... He's been through a lot.
I'm just writing his name down, that's all.
Seven people are dead.
It was for someone else, but it could work.
Look, Davis and Usher, they're in a position to protect you.
The only complaint was from Drew, who threw Monte under the bus so he could take her job.
There's a positive, wonderful glow.
Signal was messed up.
And I hope Gail is, too.
But were these fires devastating enough to cause the extinction of all of the world's dinosaurs in a single day?

How do you know my name?
Have fun with your dad today.
And we have eyes on his place at all times, and we never see anybody come or go.

- Your message sounded urgent.
You earned it when you landed a plane that was running on a sports drink.
We have to keep an eye on her.
Reverend Slattery survived.
That's the back I've got.
-We can be sure of nothing, Francis.
New tie? No, it's a Father's Day gift two years ago from Grace.
Are you trying to kill yourself?
- Yes. See you tonight, though?
They're all time-stamped.
So, did you find out where he was going?
Just secure the back of the property.
I mean, like, if we went to confession, it was nothing like seeing your father go to confession first and then come out.

She can be... very persuasive.
Before it goes to trial.
But first, may I see your golden tickets, please?
Did you bring us everything we asked for?
What? Your shirt's in the way.
Don't look so worried.
- I know.
- Hey now, we can do both.
Well, as a matter of fact, we believe you.

A mother you have not seen since you were an infant.
He was so excited, you know, like little boys get.
No, you came after me first.
- Doesn't matter who.
Hetty told me to stop in here before the hundred miles of freeway.
I know, but we haven't done it in a while.
Well, I have great respect for your professional opinion, Frances.
We're gonna blow this nuke out of the sky.
Right, so the...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, last time they found us in the middle of nowhere,
And why was he there?
- I look good.
Come on, Marcus.
Do you mean whoever sent the invitations?
Everyone, hold your positions.
I'll... I'll see you tomorrow.
Diogo's death was a trigger for this.
A DNA test.
I was careful.
Oh, yeah? Beth, do you mean 24 hours, 3-6-9?
Chug your beers.
How are you?
Get off her!
We need a record of your whereabouts on Tuesday between 11:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.
Is that my money?
Where are you going?
Uh, I slept in the office.
- Find out where the backup is.

♪ The danger must be growing
Be chilled, be chilled, be chilled, be chilled.
-You should've told us.
Yeah, you were point guard.
Okay, I'll get going.

I am protecting you.
There were loads.
and you're saying it in a weird way 'cause you don't want me to have to say to Ginny that we talked. No, I'm "not."
- I'm sorry. - How could you do that?
They didn't call us, you idiot.
No, no, Cole.
There's nothing I can do.
- What is it, Deborah?
Who else has access to the office?
How's her contract coming along?
I got a cool baby cooking' in here.
- Won't talk.
They already got the mother box from you yesterday.
Isn't that what you taught me, Raymond?
And now, you are uniting your souls, much the same way you did your penis and vagina so many times to that beautiful song.
We had no choice but to engage, and, um... uh, I'm sorry, but he's-he's dead.

Shut up and put your arms out.
She gave me her details.

My cousin works at a car wash, and he knows all about girls.
How is she?
Things have changed.

I was looking for my next target in the game.
What is it Birdsworth?
I'm gonna go back to the beginning.
So, do you know why I sent those faxes?

Something she would do if this were a simple matter of theft.

Why in the world did you do this?
I would hate to think he's capable of something like that.
But, don't worry.
The poor thing.
You can't pin that on me.
Because you're not doing your part.
I'm gonna need your password first.
Are you saying you know one of these guys?

What did happen to your mum?
Ten months ago, uh, Mexican police raided the house of a known cartel hit man in Juarez, and it was Gideon Lyon's house.
We need to bring him in.
- Did they hurt you, fucker?
She's waiting for you.
Just kill them.
Yes, but that's gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.
Like she was in a moving car. Yeah.
Give me the radio.
- No! - No? She was talking to her for fucking ages.
What's up? - Hi, Mary.
There we go.
- Well, cooee, here she is!
- It isn't with a patient, Harvey.
- Okay, Donna, you win.
Stole it from where?
I'd never catch a federal charge and go away until I'm gray.
- Mm-hmm. Since you were too busy to come to dinner, I thought, why can't dinner come to you?
We arrested DeMarcus together.
When I reached the metro door, I thought:
I know how hard it has been for her all these years with not having closure regarding her sister's murder.

Victims have been left all over the city, which means he definitely feels at home there.
All prisoners return to their units.
No sudden moves, fellas.

Well, it's, like, the middle of last period right now.
There's no way I can give you the files you're looking for.

One, two, three.
I was thinking that.
So you're gonna walk back to wherever it is you walk to and get the manifests, or I'm gonna stop this train, take your money, and give this rail line the most ridiculous PR disaster since the Newton Boys robbed that mail train in Rondout.
No, I meant to ask you that.
- No way.
I just hope he's OK.
Owen and I will be on comms.
Would you grow a pair, Billy?
- All prisoners must return
We are going to be shit hot.
I'll just put tomatoes, then.
It's probably just some faulty wiring, but give me a hand, will you?

Uh, my bad. Don't worry, Batgirl, I've got her.
Look, just stay still!
Listen, pal, you don't get to decide who stays, who goes.
Simon and I wanted to put on this dinner party to thank Dr Patterson for having faith in Simon and giving him the promotion.
We don't rush in head first. We've got lives and careers.
Almost passed out.
- Because she said it wasn't.
How you doing, Williams?
If that happens, Ray, there is no money.
It's just I saw her... it felt so real.
Yeah, okay, well, as always, I commend you on that whimsical, seemingly pointless yet suddenly relevant wind-up to what could've been a really boring bit of regular old information.
That's going to turn off Callen and Sam's comms.
He gets like that around beginners.
Well it doesn't look like robbery, sir.
Why would he drive from Manchester to Lochnafoy with a photo of you in his wallet?
- What? - My advice is bring donuts.
Where did he do that to you, Holly?
Yeah. Ezra Hayes.
Yes. Well, uh... it didn't come from a pharmacy.
You'll lose ground eventually.
He won't talk until the commercial break.
We'll take the blow from here.

Ronald Reagan went to Camp Firewood?
Yeah, that's... that is worse.
So strange to be looking at these faces again. So many dead.

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
Can I get some H?

Anything is fine.
Or... you can accept that what's past is past and move on with whatever future we all have left.
Ralph! Come on!
Yeah, but he can't prove it.
I keep thinking Dr. Marr's got something to do with all this.
This is something that I think is tightly linked to my phase of invading the feminine world.
I don't like being blackmailed.
Well, a couple years later, a regular life just wasn't really an option for me, so...
Last time I had a run-in with you guys, I went underground.
It's that, John. It's THAT attitude.
Yes... But it's a boat.
I feel like I could die.

Did you and Simon make up?
I can't release them.
He's the guy you got to file a false complaint against me.
"Right, this is what needs to happen in order for this whole, sort of, tidal wave to change."
If you could give your younger self one piece of advice, what would it be?

Well, if it wasn't for the money, then why did he kill Nanette?
How you holding up, Percy?
It's pretty shameful, since I'm already 30.

He now has taken any hope... that this was still something that we were on the same page working together.
Didn't your father talk to you about this already?
After you took the money from the atm,

So, Becks, I was, uh, wondering what the deal was with Zoe and Pin.

I feel like this is the part where I need to give a rousing speech.
- Are you working me?
Um, the people I met on the jogging path.
She gave me a compliment by saying my works were like high-quality poems.
Grandpa, I thought I saw Tom and Jerry over by the river.
No, they made contact, and they want to talk to you.
What could have been so urgent?
And I'm gonna drop the "L" word here...
You always did talk too much, man. Where the cash?
I've had it. I'm done.
So tell me. How do you feel now?
You do get that I'm in a gang, right?
She stuck a needle of gear in my neck.
-[Chela] We're in serious trouble.

We never wanted it.
You're the new supply.

The transfer hasn't come through yet.
- Yeah. David.
I won't hurt ya.

Hey, Sly, does that look normal to you?
"Oh, my God, you're going to be amazing!" Huh!
- That is gonna fly by.
You know, it's nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.
But I can get the cash tomorrow no problem. But I need it tonight.
Don't be so down in the mouth.
Somehow I doubt he'll be as eager to meet us as yesterday.
Well, that depends on the question, Your Honor.
How are you all here?
Nope, Cyndi walks in and Stone turns into a lovebird.
I think Yaron's got dry balls or something.

- Flaming hot!
- Of course. In episode two.
Is that wrong?
And no matter what you do, I will find Ms. Gunnarsdottir.
- What's that?
Give us a moment.
A new client, a good one.
She spent most of her time writing speeding tickets.
Just lookin' out for ya, love.
- I can try to run a diagnostic.
We had a meeting about it last week.
And you're looking at two wasted lives.
- Mr. Mathis, - this case is why I do what I do.
She used magic.
I got you a little Breathalyzer.
You're all that... except for the monomaniacal part.
But it's only been 36 hours since she was taken.
I don't even know if it's a boy or a girl.
We get briefing memos, too... Crimes against this country, threats to our security, people in custody who look like the right person, but don't match fingerprints on file.
- Nah, nothin'.
Hands where we can see them.
We can even threaten him with a few days in prison... with his ex-partner.
-[indistinctly] Are you ready to do it?
Why did you let me drink so much?
The mayor's working to destroy it.
It's probably Noah.
And who knows? Maybe one day, we could travel to Paris and kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower or something.
It's a two-minute procedure.
I think so, unless there's something I'm not thinking of.
Hey, listen to me. Hey, listen.
I need a hospital.
I sort of knew him from when we were kids but I didn't recognise the number.

E-MAIL FROM ELIANE
I've still got to live here when you've fucked off.
I can't see them.
Will we stay here?
Ma'am, are you okay?
It'll be a breeze, huh?
Of the end.
Maybe you're the one who needs help, Mary.
It doesn't stand out.
Those limits rise above 70%, you clear out!
I assure you it is not.
I believe this is a bad idea, Raymond.
This is her genetic profile.
This right here is a Krakinos.
Could use what you learned to help others wrongly imprisoned.
The train is on fire!
There's no wear and tear.
Which I can get you, by the way.
Come on, you slackers.
She's becoming bradycardic.
I have your wife.

He was struck in the head with something heavy, likely the cause of death.
And we can't afford to lose New Orleans as a base of operations to protect the Gulf.

I've...got the car, so, um, if there are files, I can take 'em now.

What it's like to have college scouts crawling all over you, calling you the next big thing?
It's absolutely inconceivable considering who I was not long ago.
Well, we have no reason to lie, right?
I keep up on journal articles.
It's the thing out the phone.

To your children?
No, it was quiet.

One of the horses did not take his medicine.
Come on, come on!

Rachel, I tried to be nice about this, but I'm a fourth-year associate, and I'm not wasting my time on something a first-year could handle.
We know he was bullied by Baxter.
I've had a breakin.
- Don't tell him I said this, but Mike jumped inside his phone booth and put on his Superman outfit.
I trust you with my finances.
Will and Iris came through. Establishing the link to Theo's home system.
Okay, whatever this is, does it really need to be happening in my bedroom?
My plan was just to land some jabs, every so often throw an overhand left to land-- to get some respect.
Fuck! You're all right, you're all right.
Or shortly before.
Whoo! Yeah, I heard he, like, peaked in high school.
For what is a warrior without his honor?
I don't believe in coincidence.
I swore I would never date another one after Joe.
There were small grazes and bruises around the knees consistent with playing football.
Be there at midnight.
Okay, any time you head back to the gate, that means your flight's not taking off.
I promised you some information.
She was all I knew, all I had.
So, you think he started drinking because he knew about that murder, is that what you're saying?
I'm telling you... he thought he could be in a boy band, wanted to call himself "Cal,"
There's nothing average about him.
- Come on, get out.
I can assure you the passage is safe and the documents are clean.
The former head of Russia's anti-doping agency RUSADA has unexpectedly died.
I will not be responsible for my actions.

It weighs on me sometimes.
Update. All right. Our dead burglar, Louis Cole, 37, was paroled two months ago from Haynesville Correctional Center after serving three years for transporting narcotics.
Absolutely no way.

Are you in contact with your brother?
You said what we had was real, but it was built on a lie.
Well, good for you. Mm-hmm.
Lady Greenwood passed away.
- We got a call from his school.
Bea brought us together for a reason.
Bowling did all that?
Is that music?
A lot, a lot.
Pedro Flores, inventor of the yo-yo?
You're right, you're right.
Now, this is called an active walk.
Look, it's the kid from the softball game.
Problem is no one seems to know where to find him.
Tuna salad on rye.
Good morning! Where were you?
I did you a favor.

Welcome to Bangkok.
She's killing me.
MAKE A NOTE OF IT TO WRITE A PLAY.
Heard you knock something over when you broke into his office.
Why are you wearing a dress?
They're coming for you.
But you can't pull prints off a rough surface like this.
It's solid loge, but how will going to Akron help?

Ms. Reagan, are we ready to proceed?
Probably the only way to get out of the death penalty is if you admit to who you're working for.
- Yeah. Now, who are you, little sister?
Now, Sophie Boyd hadn't met any of our guys until that evening.

Time for you to rest.
- And confirm whether or not Bobby was working.
A whole year's pay.
What, you think I wanted this?
You're crazy. You know that?
{\pos(192,210)}I think you're back to {\* your }same old ways, rushing into something {\pos(192,230)}without thinking it through.

We do this ourselves.
Then how come half of law enforcement's still out there looking for her?

And, uh, he is my ride, so I'm just...
I'm your president now, and I demand some goddamn respect!
- Damn it! I'm gonna go now.
I wouldn't have recommended that she go with us.
THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO
Off-off the record?
Iâ€™m an action movie star now. I'm done with the festival fare. I'm sure you'll get someone good.
Well, this is unexpected.
Come at me.
What can I do?
Hey, Capp, you're gonna want to cut right here.
I hate hospitals.
And I had a sit-down with Bob, the manager, who has hairy knuckles, but is nice.
- I worked my arse off to look after you!
Hey. Who were those guys?
We didn't have time to trace the call, but we will find her.
Well, come on.
Like I've identified a culprit.
Is it working?
Yeah, but think about all the jobs that it's gonna create.
Look, I've got a bad back.
Previously on Scorpion...
Do you have any other access?
That's it. I'm calling right now.
Think him and Hetty are working on something off-the-books?
I'll get a dustpan and brush.
... but it was too late to cancel the cake.
- See you tomorrow.
Well, we're just following up on a few things.
An old catcher's mitt.
We should prepare for the worst.
Need them sooner. Without documents, I can't leave this place.
Slow clap, all the points.
You find me the truth.
11th of May, 1967.
No, I don't want to hurt your feelings. I never want... the last thing on Earth I want to do is hurt your feelings.
She never was.
Come in, come in, come in.
I suggest you get your priorities straight.
Kimmy Schmidt is free, okay?
For some reason, they pay me one million yen a month in rent.
We should probably get going.
I made that clear from the start.
No, no, no. Please don't.
Where'd she go?
Uh, it's also New Orleans.
This guy's totally hot.
- Time-out, time-out! How 'bout that?
So that was your move, to get me in the shit with Kaz.
There were traces of a white residue on the garrote used to kill Blanco.
They just wanted to see if I knew where Emilia was, and I don't.
So... don't suffer any longer.
There are digital Enigma simulators online, but Bonzi uses a real one.
Ah, someone told me you're a peer worker.
He was a local real estate broker, a model citizen.
Oh, well there's a surprise.
You're a sensei, right?
The only positive is my death can help other people.
What kind of girl you lookin' for?
Ah, you can't expect me to trust you if you don't trust me, right?
Who's trying to take her?
He went out on a limb, and now I have been promoted to a position that people think I'm not ready for.
Will you be alright on your own?

The murderer has turned himself in.
Well, can we put a percentage on it?
- Where's Lucado?
You know, like, go show him what he's missing, like your strong, chapped hands.
Uh, I'm not lying.
The victim was four feet nine inches tall. Average height for his age. And well nourished.
To do with me and Philip.
Losing Remi was a risk inherent to the plan.
We go where our hearts take us.
To Chicago. Why Chicago?
I will be safe under here.
And so I toast to all of you, and I toast to Camp Firewood.
Don't pretend like you don't know how this works.
And why risk being seen in a busy parking garage?
I had to make a decision.
I made Paige feel the way Julia made me feel... which is very bad.
Oh, thank you.
Doctor Patterson agrees with me.
She was the only one I told, and then she's killed, and Hitchin asks me to look into a suspect.
God, I never fuckin' get it.
I wouldn't wanna be anywhere else.
When I was on board, I thought it needed a little je ne sais quoi.
I was wrong to take Robin out of the hospital.

And in order to reach the Space Station, we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable.
Come on, you can't be worried about what you've done, only what you're gonna do.
Neither can I. The FBI would grab us on sight.

As a matter of fact, there is.
Reverend, I never should have doubted your beliefs.
I can on your way into and out of it.
I think it's back on.
I don't like sitting around my place these days.
He is cute though, isn't he?
- Deborah Hampshire!
Come on, Danny.
Forty-eight hours, buddy?
Paul, help me, please. I'm really scared.
It's a lot to take in.
- Hello, Bubba.
I can't let you limp.
You live on your own?
Mind if I join you?
Sounds like a big night.
Can we just order?
I don't have this type of denial.
My landscaper said the tree had some dry rot, and my wife said I should take care of it. Yeah, I hear ya.
But worry not. I won't force you to do anything.
Get away from that! Put that down.
Right on schedule.
Did she say why?
I asked him if he had heard from the kidnapper, but he just told me to stay quiet about what happened.
- Yeah, but you're not looking at me.
- Did they provide any evidence? - No.
- Please. Please, could you just make contact with him at police
And so you get defensive and shut down.
What do you want?
It's a similar phenomenon.
He does real estate.
But we had Masumi Arimura all set for it.
I-I can't use you as a crutch.
And because they have domestic testimony obligations.
The guy looks like he swallowed a bag of lemons... but underneath it all, he's surprisingly...
Fact is, I think you moved a little too fast back there. Trying to take the suspect down without us.
This can't be right.
Go, go, go! Go! Go.
Leave 'em alone, Juice.
This is my associate, Miss Watson.
How big was it?
- You know that.
Why are you here?
Reddington, there's something wrong.
Gambaro's making you look weak.
- happening here... - No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you.

The evidence clearly contradicts Agent Percy's statement to the court.
Well, you look like hell.
Just wait a minute and call 911.
There he goes, to follow Miranda.
I was off my face.
Similarities in the two cases.
If you can't do that, you'll go back to jail.
He said he was an uncle.
This is super awesome.
- Are you going to deny any of it?
- Louis, I don't feel comfortable doing that.
Trouble up the mill?
Well, since we don't know where the bleed is,
I was given a message for you.
Determining the set... That was another story.
Did you forget your password again?
When I had appendicitis, she told me to walk it off.
What's going on?
- Bite my ankles?
Just tying up some loose ends.
I believe in you, Liz.
I didn't tell him anything.
The bullets hit every major artery and organ, and any one of them would've sufficed.
Agenda's clear for a few days.
Happens all the time, he said.
We need those flights and those names.
My assistant can validate your...
You're scaring me.
- I want your word on that, because if someone ever asks...
The risk of an entire medical staff being slaughtered by a terrorist are high and immediate.
I've made it worse, Vera.
- You know what?
And I'm not worried about what she thinks.
Hurry it up!
You need to switch to crack.
"We, the 28 members of NATO, are determined to investigate this incursion."
But when I was little, I always thought that they were saying "empties,"
- We're gonna take a video.
- A garden salad.
We need to shut it down before that ship makes the Panama Canal.
That's so weird, I had this dream last night that Bumblebee and Katana were robbing a jewelry store and they had this weird look in their eyes and their hair was glowing too and we were all like, "Stop, evildoers!" And then we went on this chase
I have an invitation from Sofia.
- You organised a CSDS raid yesterday.
Sounds like a man who's compensating.
EPISODE 8 REASON
But here I am.
- Still no sign of Dolls, huh.
Talk to me, honey.
To be honest, I've been thinking I won't be the people's voice anymore.
A lot more than that.
Like I just said, all you need the right chance.
She knew the threat was imminent, and yet she turned a blind eye.
Whoa, check out his date of birth... that's today.
That's the thing burning, isn't it?
Please. I've gone to the police.
All of this for a strawberry.
He broke my heart.
- Like Vikings.
Give her extra-large ones, she only goes with men with big cocks.
To avoid more deaths, to save lives.
Have you looked into the matter of Officer Macklin?
Is everything okay, Sam?
Court footage of the Ortega case?
Guys like Eric Cates, they risk their lives for us.
But we can't let Hamilton distract us.
Everyone should be up.
Sabrina tied me up so I couldn't get into any trouble while she's out shopping.
He asked if you did your makeup on a trampoline.
You have interfered with my master plan for the last time.
This shit is like 3,000 a bottle.
Michi is in real trouble.
We're not doing nothing. Go ahead. They're good.
You think I don't have enough crazy shit going on in my life?
She must have known that if she used Sandstorm terms, you would intercept the call.
-I don't think you're in a position to...
We have lots of smaller decorations, and we've got snowflake garlands up the wazoo, even though I told Beth to stop making them half an hour ago.
Today's going to be about swearing in the jury and Rachel, our prosecution barrister, standing up and outlining our case.
- What did she say?
How were the Caymans?
Uh, what's her name?
This was the only path to get us to this moment where you and I can own it all.
Now where's our stuff?
It's time to move! Time to move!
A wound doesn't heal if you keep opening it up.
I don't presume to know the details of what your father did to you and your family.
'You just don't know, do you, when people disappear? '
And the other one is a boxer.
Guys, you know I can't believe that Beth is gonna sell this place.
Trust me, it's not the kind of crowd you want at Molly's.
We were doing surveillance.
I know, I'm sorry.
All she did was pretend to be her sister.
I'm not sure I agree with that.
November 6, 1979.
The dead person ends up with nothing.
I said, leave.
[Patricia] General Aguirre.
Look, I told you...'
Are you looking at me?
- What are you sorry for?
The single biggest beneficiary from terrorism, dollar for dollar?
You and I are going to the police now.
Hi, this is Becky... and Bob.
- So we kill them.
Lavar Spann, we have a warrant to search your business and all records found within.
Get the hell out.
That's right. How'd you know?
I make love as much as I need to.
I don't feel well.
It was all sunshine and presents till they were getting plastic bags over their heads while four men fucked them up the arse.
I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.
We'll need your passport again for some paperwork, and you should have your car right away.
One of the reasons I work so hard not to lose myself is 'cause I fear I would also lose you.
All the guests were with you in the dining room and all the staff were here in the hallway.
Jonas, this is it.
- Oh, you're a champion.
I know it's silly, but knowing sports is my job, and now I'm turning into a laughing stock at the one thing I'm supposed to be good at.
Sorry, I'll take it off.
You really don't know Mia, do you?
See you, Jord!
That's exactly why.
[in English] He doesn't have time. [in Spanish] So, be careful with what you say or he'll just blow you off.
If we keep at it... we'll get there.
- And they reckon having a baby hurts.
Do you ever wonder what they're doing when we're not there? All the time.
It's just how I am. It's a guy thing.
- I'm getting it back.
- Did two sleep last night? - It looks like it is.
I'm making my celebrated 12-hour ribs, baby.
I don't think Harvey wears tighty-whities. - Oh, Jesus Christ, Rachel.
Yeah, something should go boom on the far side of the complex.
We've mostly done what you've wanted to do, like you leaving me with my father.
You work in the law.
The Spanish people are with you.
What are you wearing?
How much I am shielding you from the pressure we're under.
Good morning, everyone.
Like a ghost in the night.
One of them noticed an encryption device in his apartment.
- What about the...
He shook your hand.
Well, would you look at that.
Wanna see me do the robot?
Do you want me to tell him, or should I?
He'd been living there for a shitload of years.
What, you found something?
We will win this war for the safety of our children.
'I don't know.
Home is where I'd go.
You want me to crash?
And that way, they're not just more likely to stay, they're more likely to recommend Team ProFine to other eSport stars.
You're creepy, Nanaka.
'Cause I'm just saying, on Fourth of July, I might whip out my bottle rocket and do the Uncle Sam dance.
We're getting to the bottom of that.
I put Kaz in hospital.
Who are they?
And who knows?
Raven is a different horse, and that's all because of you.
Ms. Wyngold wanted them all to look their best, so she gave them makeovers-- haircuts, new clothes, that kind of thing.
You did it!
I wish you could tell me that, too.
Do you know anything about your mom? Is she in hiding?
My baby won't know me after that long a time.
- So how are we going to get there?
Although I do prefer My Fair Lady.
- Okay, so it's a tie.
Where are they?
I held my baby.
No sign of the mayor.
Have you tried music therapy?
You haven't wiped your mouth at all.
Mr. President, we're running out of time.
As you can see, I lost my legs in an accident when I was young.
Their entire document cache would be up for grabs.
Let's hope Mia's not online.
Fuck, Shayne's gone to the cops!
You know, I've been keeping this down here just for you.
She's not a fucking number, Emilia.
We're not giving it the same depressing name as him.
You have my word,
"In a way."
Tell me what happened.
Everybody has their hobbies, Mike.
If it is, we wait until the girl is safely out of the vehicle.
Can you make her stop?
I ended up in this nuthouse because I believed you back then, bought into all of it.
These are standard Deputies Committee security protocols, sir.
-[Zyan] Hold on. -I don't have a clear shot.
I don't understand how these guys are always so damn late.
It's lack of oxygen.
Faison said he'd cover for me.
We were very upset she was holding up contract negotiations for the second season of Sex and the City.
Don't count on it.
Yeah, well, that's too bad.
Or maybe I need a supplier with bigger balls.
Can you put your full weight on it?
Sorry, I'm a little bit confused by what's gone on here.
They were really happy.
Hello! How are you?
So, um, police everywhere have been looking to use more and more nonlethal ammo.
This is real?
Thus, details about this pony are scarce.
Long time no see.
What was that?
I prayed to God... for answers. [dramatic music]
Rosie doesn't do walks.
Of course she can swaddle.
I told Mrs. Shaheen that he was stealing answers from me for the spelling test, and she told me to cover my paper and mind my own business.
I called many times.
Which would explain the staining on his hands - and the use of his suitcase.
That was my condition!
- She had a fever, I have swimmer's ear.
I took care of it.
Hebrew is such a beautiful--
Heist crew were pros, took out cameras, jammed communication, knew exactly what they were after and where to get it.
That's a great idea.
You're all right.
- I answered it. - Wasn't your job to answer it!
Well, as much as I'd like to see where... this goes, if nobody has anything else...
Uh, thank you for this.
I think we share certain qualities.
And what about this?
- Pulse is thready. - ...
I'm just doing my share, Deputy Secretary, by selling my investor on the Mars project.
She funneled the money into a private Panamanian account, which can only be frozen if you have a court order, unless... it's a little tricky, but I can do a little work...
You're calling the shots now.
But I'm here because I have something to tell you-- a story that I'm sorry to say will cause you profound grief and anger.
Do you recognise this?
It is. These are pot pies.
I think I found a place to live.
'Cause if you don't call, she'll wonder why, and then she might figure it out.
Focus on breathing.
Looks like your declaration of love will have to wait.
Because I promise you... I'm not gonna stop until every last one of them is dead.
Are you all right, lovey?
Cain, give him another ten.
Yes, of course.
Here, hold this.
Thank God that's over.
I know, Chela.
He was released this morning. What?
Okay, he's dying, and it's all on you.
Why? It's just better if you do.
- He definitely won't be around.
Drank like a fish.
Procedure runs about 1,500 without it.
Now you're gonna see what a real Top Dog's like.
I mean, he's doing well socially, right?
Don't touch that drawer.
I've been here for hours, and no one has told me anything.
She must have wanted it.
What should I say I do for a living?
I altered your fate so that we could be a family together.
Is something wrong?
It's a date.
And he didn't pay by credit card.
We're just helping Auntie Jamie fix the plane.
- That sounds lovely...
No, for reals.
IF IT IS, I THINK THIS IS THE END OF ONE.
Jasper! We're not done here.
I need to leave.
He can come to Guatemala.
So it has to work.
Now you must go.
- Excuse me, and your dad...
But she had such a great support network.

You know where she lives? Yeah.
Well, maybe he knew her, but he didn't tell you about it.
I can't force you to ride for us, Zoe.
You just sold me up shit creek!
It's flying over our heads in a zillion pieces and it gets reassembled over there.
A part of me really wanted to believe the old fucker.
The defense, they brought in Paul McHugh, who is a heavy hitter to bring into a courtroom.

♪ Are you on my team?
Ah, I know.
I don't like surprises, Philip.
Why target them?
They bought the last Wonka bar in town.
And how about the Bronx D.A.?
I-I didn't recognize the number, but I thought maybe you switched phones.
Now, she was, uh... she was looking like one of our favorites.
She smothered us with love, that's for sure. Yeah.

PRIVATE SECURITY ...and the man in the red shorts comes back with a one-two combo during this 12-round fight.
A guy can't box five days in a row without headgear without getting banged up.
Because you always see what's coming down the line, right?
I also think there are stalking and harassment laws on the books for a reason.
So he's not just a mummy, he's a John Doe.
Anything in the locked room?

- I'll call you tomorrow about the acquisition, Louis.
All of you.
Eli... we're with the FBI.
But first, you need to tell me what happened here.
I needed him to cover me. There's not a cop in the world, at least none that I know, who are gonna give up their entire career over one questionable collar.
Why won't he stop?
Is he back there?
This company is losing money, and I'm doing everything that I can to keep it afloat.
We are all in trouble.

You pump that expanding concentrate into a hose that is tied off, and the pressure will be so great, it'll lift the rocks off Walter!
It's in his mouth, his esophagus, stomach, and the entire length of his gastrointestinal tract.

They live streamed the torture on a burner phone that they dumped at the scene.
So, his own statement is an ideal, used to justify his self-interest.
Fill it up.

I rolled back the DOT camera you called about.
Mr. Washburn, you make your money manufacturing a product which kills tens of thousands of Americans every year, so you'll understand if we don't readily take you at your word.
Oscar, there's no price that'll make the pain go away.

Mom, Dad, I did good.
Einstein replies, "But only to an observer who saw us walk in simultaneously."
What are they whispering?
Because of what we did.
Doesn't mean they don't love you.
Why kill four people over it?
You dragged your ass for 10 miles to safety. You lit rescue fires.
It kind of stings like a baby mosquito.
She could have died.
We got two more rent-a-thugs down the hall.
You know, one of us is gonna have to reach out over this platform and grab that balloon.
Clem, what are you not telling me?
Stay with them.
You're like, "If I was in that situation, I'd have totally done something."
She was best friends with the groom, and she married him?
And plus, it makes you less annoying.
That copper's wrong.
My daughter-in-law was too, and also Rafael.
And I'm running late, so...
Hi. Can you come get me?
I'll be seeing you.
No, let's just think about what we're gonna do, OK?

Thank you for trying, Beth.
Kill yourself, mate.

Well, the plane's blankets are a cheap polyester blend, big enough to cover the bamboo frame, and light enough to rise from the hot air.
Actually, yes, you can.
All right, all right.
You saw an angle.
No, no, no. Hans was taken by the Taddicken Brothers, known around the world for their savagery.
We looked at him because Edgar's first wife, who I believe, she gave us this complicated story, and we researched it and looked it up, and everything was true.

And I never knew until I listened to that interview that this subject plagued my brother.
I'm gonna kill you!
For the most part, I believed that something happened.
- I should take the call.
- I'm sure you can understand.
I will. Look, right now, he just needs to get over that comfort hump, then we can totally throw Melissa into the mix.
No more secrets.
Anyway, enough with the feelings.
You're just a little bit worried it might.
I made one mistake and if I could take it back, I would.
I was just saying how nice of him it was to offer us his house for a couple of weeks.
What a surprise.
Obviously, you're aware of your own clients.
It's a virtual certainty.
Boat on its way?

You're not doing this.
Just have a few questions.
It's a manifest.
- Oh, Martha did most of it.
You know I am immune to your charms, right?
He doesn't want to live like that.
I swear, this is where I hid it.
Plus, that's not going to cost anything, which is the kind of bright idea that clients love.
I just knew.
- Shift over.
Who is it? Some guy you gave your card to at the crime scene this morning.
I'll be released when I turn 18.
We work together.
No, we were wrong about the five minutes.
Teresa wasn't doing all this to make a lot of money.
No, I'm sorry.
Okay, Harley's code thingies made no sense.

I believe that Cathy Cesnik was murdered... by someone she knew.
Is this... Su-Jin?
No, I don't think you do.
We put off everything to help this guy.
Ray told me about your boyfriend's death.
You're not really considering working for him, are you?
I did get that thrown out, but I told him, you have to stay off the corners in Baltimore and not look suspicious. And how do you explain that to a young... a young boy, not to look suspicious, you know?
It was a sick move.
He's the courage you never had, cool head in a crisis.
Don't sneak up.
He wants extra security.
He says, "Thank you."
I've got a match on the license plate.
Never been in trouble with no-one.
That's probably not true.
How come you got a new name?
Still, it goes without saying, if any of you want to bow out...

Details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
Maybe fixed things.
Turn up the volume so all can hear.
Joan, you take over here.
I imagine it must be hard to have to stay at arm's length from your daughter's treatment, but... And this goes without saying, but I'm just want to say it anyway... Dr. Kwon and I will do everything we can to make sure Robin gets the best possible care.
Let me know when you want to try again, Zoe.
Selwyn's just been telling me about his dancing.
Come on, donâ€™t let me leave like this.
Couldn't you have done egg and chips?
Petrie's trying to get things back to normal.
Mr. Michima. are you related to the condemned criminal Tatsuyuki Michima?
So, uh... is that what it looked like?

Not something, miss Jenny.
Will you marry me?
Wait on my signal.

And I am just waiting for a call to... to find out that everything is okay, and my phone is not ringing.
Just to be clear, this is not a date.
It almost got yourself killed.
I don't have the resources to handle this alone.
And the American people never trusted your mother.
Lots of witnesses.
Elizabeth, we had nothing to do with it.
I'm trying to find some peace with this and you're not helping.
I'd say you're royally fucked.

- I was just gonna call you.
What's going on in here?
And here you are... perfect.
THE CURSED HOUSE!
Is that his taxi? Yeah.
Are you a pro at this kind of thing?
He uploaded that image from his own computer.
No, it is password-protected, so it's gonna take a while.
See, I figure you needed these to load your gun, but then you forgot you had them on when you went into the next room to shoot Johnny Martelli.
The evidence is her panties on the floor of my kitchenette.
Let's pick this motherfucker off!
It relies on us being stupid and cowardly.
My friend from school was on the cover of Pony People Magazine.
Dry, salty fish.
Wow. I'd love to.
- Why not?
- I was expecting a fight.
But that's what we do for each other.
I want you to take me home and buy me my own chocolate factory, Daddy.
Now, you and Happy get up on the roof, hang onto the cable, and then we'll sever the cable to detach the gondola.
I swear to God.
Course you can. When there's a break.
When Isaac called, he said that they were giving him candy for breakfast.
Do you know the world record for solving one of these things currently stands at 4.9 seconds.
Yes, he's aware, not that it matters.
Well, I found something interesting on the nightstand in his bedroom.
All things must have a resolution, like Yuzu Hanaki's works.
We found her car in a ravine along with her medication.
As we expected, it is a sliver of brain from Niall Swift.
She was a massive card-writer.
And Bob ate my prom dress.
- No, no, no.
And the problem is, the rest of the world is way ahead of us.
Glad you liked it.
Afraid that I couldn't teach you everything you needed to know.
We only have one shot at this, okay?
'Innocent white victims. Dark-skinned abusers.'
They come around as often as leap years.
Tell her I want to fuck her.
- No, just friends.
- Do you have the guts to do that?
No, we're not in contact.
- Yeah, you do.
I'll be back in a bit to check on you.
I told Trevor to be outside at 0600.
Some of his parents.
It's illegal to tell a target of an investigation that you've been called to testify.
It could be worth more than you realize.
- Oh, yeah.
- I did...
- Stung, yeah? Okay.
That'll be all.
But as the cloud started to clear, months or years later, the dormant plants came back to life.
I've never seen you like this.
I really do, yeah.
I won't blame you.
I'd be implicating myself, wouldn't I?
And do you remember Mercer visiting that evening?
I'm not going to let her do it anymore.
It's gotta be something. He's not easily spooked.
You're all doomed!
What's going on?
You're coming with me.
The cause of the president's death was a gunshot wound.
Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.
The fight for mankind's survival has just begun.
Where are they going?
Summat funny? Yeah, you.
Help me, please! - We need to sedate her.
CIA, the FBI, Freedom of Information Act request.
And we all have a dark and light.
Zoe, do you mind?
- Go away!
Preventing other insects from entering.
I'm fine, I think.
Let me remind you, Ms. Charles, in case the air is too thin to breathe atop that soap box, that you are an epidemiologist, and I am the one responsible for running this hospital.
- Do you?
Question is, how did he dose Bonzi's coke?
Well, it's nice to see you in your element.
Your dad wants to talk to you.
And you know T.C. He sees danger, he goes right toward it.
What are you doing?
I just went.
It's going to be on Drudge within the hour.
Real shame how it went sideways on him.
I'll get the money to pay back the debt.
With Emma. It was our first adventure together, though my motives were less than chivalrous then.
I will not be accepting your money anymore.
It's been picking off Don's sheep.
Mr. Chislett, you're still in heart failure.
Yep, all right. Okay, bye.
He, uh, decided to hang up his iron?
Ms. Brown, I know what this woman put you through, but she's locked up now.
Don't let this ruin your day.
Time to get to work.
Well, that's no problem. We can talk to him about how we're all on the same side.
You heard her.
I watch for your mistakes, try to beat you to the punch.
Now, who's going to tell me, is benzoic acid an ionic or a covalent compound?
- I hope you're not here to offer me my job back.
- Good evening, Mr. President.
But you've gotta understand that, from where I'm sitting, this is enough for Bobby to blackmail your father.
This area's meant to be rich in this sort of stuff.
-But now, the children need me. -Mrs.
I-I'm sorry I kind of ditched you guys the other day.
Could we at least sleep in the car?
Who's in there?
Jesus! Are you OK?
When you're from where I'm from you lose people.
No need to thank me.
You almost just got me arrested over a bag of chips.
You just had a baby - by fucking Caesarian.
I didn't kill anyone. Look, I turned him down because I already knew the location of the Santa Leticia.
Not as much as it scares you.
It's not important who gets the credit.
- I promise.
There have been a few developments.
I mean, if you need a hand with ghost catching.
"Plan." She has a plan beyond just unleashing pain and terror?
I... I get that.
You don't need to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders, love.
Right. You see bad, you stop it.
Anyway, you shouldn't have gotten dragged into our issues.
Also, just a quick heads up...
Okay, let's go. Come on.
Why do you ask?
Of course it does and so do you, but just not the way we do.
You almost done with that 61?
Did you leak information to her?
Thank you, Sheldon.
I don't go through mail. - Okay.
We both want the same thing - for this to be over.
Yeah, well, you didn't do anything, it was me.
She seems happy there as well.
- I'm already on it. You better get some sleep.
She's okay. She's okay!
- I'm not trying to get him out now.
I really have become the cool one around here.
- Hi. It's just for the weekend.
I kissed a boy.
Can you hear me?
And you're personally guaranteeing it?
- Syd, you okay?
Take your time.
- This is Missy.
If you need help, we can pay for counseling.
The certainty of my desires... They always came...
My name is Sherlock and I'm an addict.
He'd be alive right now if not for me!
Tell me or there's no telling what I will do!
How about a metal straw from a vintage milkshake kit?
L.A.'s dark side rearing its ugly head.
This is about Harvey running this firm into the ground.
After reviewing the alternatives, we believe that this is the next best option.
Why can't we just live together?
High on that list is defending the flock.
I just don't want Jillian to feel like...
How do we set it?
Did you know about that?
Look, I know that guy.
Get out of the way!
It's gonna be great. - Yeah.
There you go, miss.
Let's see, you're the publisher guy.
You're going to repeat all this before the Attorney General.
That can't be good.
Why did Hall single out Kennedy?
What if Colin Mitchell could?
Brangelina, you take... Thirty-four points damage.
You know him?
Lee might not be the only one.
"The Shadow demands the thrill of fangs and claws, the dog within going wild after a lifetime on the leash."
Back off, Kenny.
Well, if it's a matter of money maybe I could help out.
I know who I'm talking to.
That was a routine examination.
Am I sure?
You can't place him at the scene, you don't have enough.
And the money.
I should take a look.
We made it known you're looking for information.
That's not what I mean.
You said it was difficult with her, but the way you tell it, it doesn't sound like it.
At least this place gives them a chance.
Morrison's not going to trust your word.
- I've gone over each one.
Do you have any idea what my childhood was like?
This kid, Corey Jenkins... he works here?
- Amado will keep them under control.
Yeah, she was, but... it wasn't her looks. It was her brains that put her out of my league.
They don't have dances.
I'll get the last load, you start putting it away?
While you're playing good cop, his boys could be on the way to your ranch right now.
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to kill Ramón.
No way is this sigil 40 years old.
How am I supposed to help you find out something like that?
All he cares about is keeping this place barely running for the next month to impress NASA.
Okay, Pin Cam. What have you got for me?
You've done all you can, Doctor. It's with Allah now.
They're onto Audubon, which means it's only a matter of time before they link it to you.
All evidence to the contrary.
He turned on Revolución.
Look, it's a great way to bring in new business.
To the living, all that's left are regrets and remorse.
You may be able to hide from your friends or from the rest of the world, but I know who you really are.
- Because what you're doing is being unkind.
Man, I don't know what I know anymore.
- I can't.
They owe us, and I'm gonna make them pay.
I thought I was here because of Niall Swift.
Carol is scared to tell you that she wants me to deliver the baby.
If you try and come in here, I will smash your fuckin' tits in!
She is paraplegic.
All right, let me know when you know.
I should say "good morning."
It means "white butterfly" in Portuguese.
This show-jumping outfit is so cute.
Sorry. No, Th... yeah.
There is no point in keeping the truth from anna. So I'm bringing her in.
It can't be worse than dried fish.
What's going on? I told you I'd come down tomorrow.
You were gonna throw away your career.
Don't let her go past!
Oh, my God.
♪ Loves me late at night. ♪
- I've always taken care of you.
He tells me your situation changed.
And how long do you think it's gonna take for this brain of mine to go bad?
We just, caught a peek at the catalog.
- I told you, she's my therapist.
You may have noticed that I called you Gail? Rather than Mom.
- If he was in Bangkok in the last three days, he's the one who killed Lin.
Your wife was never meant to be taken.
You would have.
- It's not a technicality.
How would it look in court?
And then we're meant to learn from them, not repeat them 300,000 times.
Hey, just stay right here and look at me, okay?
Something's wrong with the main battery unit.
- Well, how long have I fuckin'
Well, that's not going to happen. First thing tomorrow, you're going to go and get a solicitor.
I'm allowed to water twice a week!
I say actions speak louder than words.
- What? Bye.
There is none.
It's totally unnecessary.
I'm sorry, boss, but I can't ditch Miguel Ángel that easily.
Mitch, I went over the data.
I mean, it would come and go, so we just thought he had the flu.
Why would you say that?
You look fit.
Keen wasn't informing Reddington.
In case you forgot to eat.
- Where's the gun?
- I'm not afraid of no payback, okay?
All right. [Gloves snap]
Both groups share millenarian philosophies and VFF has had contact with another jihadist group in the past.
It'll pay for itself.
Smells an awful lot like self-dealing to me.
Am I, Miss Holier Than Thou?
- I'm Joan.
Got me to thinking about how we use the weapons at our disposal, and, as importantly, the ones that maybe we're underusing...
Trust your gut.
And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.
That man is a fraud, Neil.
That hag's right, Canek.
What's her name, Sam?
- No, you can't, because right at this moment...
Yes, it is delicious.
Sometimes I can't tell if someone's upset, but once I know, I feel lots of empathy.
God, I should've known.
You know, in your books, you always take more credit than you're due.
I can physically feel pain here.
But Guzmán Loera is no ordinary criminal.
I'm kinda busy right now, but it's really good to hear your voice.
It's probably nothing.
That we're doing all we can to find his daughter and figure out what happened.
When Al and I run away to Paris, you can come with us and be our maid.
Jackson's gonna die, isn't he?
God, that was quick.
I want what you want...
"Barking, 'Dapper pups, dapper cuts'"?
And I'll join you as soon as I finish up these blueprints.
In this new world, we will make the rules.
I didn't know what I was doing or saying.
That old rag?
Hard right, Captain Jacobs!
Is it okay with them?
Yeah, I was trying to be the perfect wife.
Do you, Killian Jones, take this woman to be your wife and to love her for all eternity?
But you're only leaving me out.
That looks like our victim.
How did it go with Bonzi's little brother?
Someone's at the door.
Camila will surround you with distractions.
No, Mitchell, that's for livestock.
So I can find somewhere to piss and somewhere else to sleep.
Because they're perverts.
Payback for what I did to your leg, I get that, trust me.
I know it's hard to believe, but I was a golden boy once.
That'll give us time to come up with our cover story.
One that can be activated or deactivated with the flick of a switch...
What are you doing?
Mal says we're looking for a barn.
There was a guy last week on Ben Nevis in flipflops.
You know she did!
You want to let me pretend just... a minute longer?
And uranium is what's gonna get us there.
You're-you're ruining my celebration and my bath. All right.
Good? - Let's go.
Why do you keep staring at them?
Through their mother's personal photographs and childhood home movies, the people who knew and loved her reveal a Diana we've never seen before.
Now that I've had some time to think about it.
Thank you for keeping him safe, making him so happy.
We didn't find any prior arrests when we ran your name through the system.
I can't believe your dad bought you another horse. Ha.
Yeah, at least one person read the Veritas and lived.
You know there's no way that's happening, right?
Jane, headed your way.
I mean, what does Shepherd want?
It's time we talked to Sam.
Each of the women received an invitation from someone and came to my house.
I got a letter and there was something in it that I only told Pennisi about.
- Okay, Miss...
- Come on, let's go.
I'm 26 years old...
So tell me, what's the point of Article IV then?
- We know it. - You know it.
Any word from our friends at the ACLU?
Bye for now, Liz.
And at that time, they only had... I think it was 18 captains in the whole force, and I was one of 18.
I should be, but I'm not.
No charges were ever laid.
And me and SECDEF go way back, believe me.
I know, but you haven't yet.
But I prayed.
Oh, I got it.
I'll send Sebastian to collect evidence.
This is what we know so far.
And, well, one would practically be hugging, so there you have it.
I understand you have a history of bicuspid aortic regurgitation, and you've been having chest pains.
But how do you know? It could be a cry for help. We should talk to her.
- Why? They didn't love it each other enough to stay together, before.
Was Dylan really abused?
Will you just give me a minute?
! - She's fuckin' rinsed.
I'm headed there now.
One call from my father to the police, and you'll all be arrested.
- she's been on. - Nope.
So... you know, maybe in the deep recesses of my mind, yeah.
Week 10 and counting.
She was grilling you about it?
We're like a needle in a haystack.
Should cover all the doctor's bills.
Limburger, limburger, limburger, limburger, come on!
I'd be disappointed if you did.
He got to him in prison.
That's why we're here, Mr. President, to support you no matter what.
Our team managed to cure the animals, but at a terrible cost.
I know what your father would have wanted me to do.
And I doubt the others would agree.
You are so gonna be my partner in shop class.
What did I do wrong?
There's no address, no phone number.
What did he do to deserve that anyway?
Yes, I'm fucking Vera, you hammerhead.
Yeah, I know, I know.
So they think, "Oh, boy, I can probably beat him."
- We have a task force assembled but I want you and Intelligence to run your investigation.
Mr. Chislett, you need to stay awake for me, all right?
I did what I thought was necessary.
They're not nice people, David.
Go back to the hotel.
Picking off another Reddington loyalist.
This is going to be a long 10 minutes.
Probably in Orleans Parish, based on what I can make of the maps.
Keith Tasker and Andrew Latimer.
I am revitalizing... a blighted neighborhood.
I'm just trying to keep the promise that we both made!
Make sure you bring the right one back.
He made breakfast.
I really... This team is very important to me, and I would never do anything to mess that up.
It's been years...
It was my dad's place.
We don't even know what it opens.
You were the girl under the floor.
Come here, you.
You get our people to the safe zone. We'll have Octavia ready for the fight.
If your friends keep getting you into trouble, they're not your friends.
I can't stop thinking about our life together.
Nah, I'm tired of fighting.
Um, you know what? It's my mistake.
When you were little, were you afraid of the dark?
This job will not be without its challenges.
He doesn't want to kill an American FSO, he just wants his empire back.
- You organise an extra delivery.
It's all right, Sherlock.
Please, I just want to apologise.
You guys have anything stronger than a Dr. Shazz in that mini-fridge?
So she broke your heart.
- Yeah. - These two look very close in age.
Yeah, well the last time I checked, she doesn't get a vote.
You know, I had no idea that I could love this much.
Do you understand?
It may have been 18 months and 11 days, but I know when a man is in bed with me.
Yes, I am divorced.
Just gonna have a hell of a hangover, a nasty concussion, but she'll survive.
They are alive and well, a half hour away in Ellenville.
What's all this?
And what have we done to stop it?
Bryan's in that group data.
These are the details from this afternoon.
One washcloth, as requested, courtesy of one.
Or I'll kill you myself, honest to God.
- You had her killed?
- You didn't have to do that.
- We'll make it. Batgirl's right.
Why would I kill a guy over a book when I could just go buy another copy?
I thought that Shinwell might see the wisdom in turning himself in.
What about the helmettals?
Then I think you should listen to your conscience.
Uh, excuse me. A little bit of personal space?
I need you to destroy Roarke.
Better be quick though that's starting to smell.
It's like this.
How can I help you?
- You can write your own check.
Hamilton's too much of a coward.
I only ask because we don't love doing it.
One year probation.
Educated Eaton and Cambridge.
If we can get these documents, then we can blow the lid off of phase two.
What I want to say is, I appreciate it.
East Lake is strong, but even the strongest can say "uncle."
No, it's not that simple.
He'll have to fight three more times over the next three days to earn a spot at the Olympic trials, a year from now, in Reno, Nevada.
Well, if you're right, got to think the killer didn't want to leave behind video - of what he'd done.
We could go dancing.
There's nothing I can do.
I think I was with Mitch, but it's hazy.
You knew the Feds were closing in, so you decided to fake your husband's funeral.
- Yeah. - I mean, you're a surgical fellow, buddy.
I didn't see Lloyd twisting your arm to make it happen last night.
But it cannot be just about the body.
I mean, at 26, it should look like an old catcher's mitt.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- They were too good.
How can I?
Sorry I'm not 72 virgins.
To attend a friend's funeral.
Happy to meet you too.
You looked me in the eye... and you promised me.
Not for anything.
"May, you're a blithering idiot, and your stupid car is ruining my day."
They are a language, in a way.
Or was it payback?
I'm just here for the game.
Open your trunk.
I'm not afraid he'll talk.
It's a breach of my parole.
His phone locations show he left his loft, drove straight there, arrived at 10:21 p.m., but the closest crime scene is three blocks away.
Just napkins and plates.
Time to go. Waste no more time."
Do not approach.
- Why not?
She said that.
We need to leave now.
Just look up.
I knew it was always Magnus.
Hey, swan, I got your message.
According to any of the belt rules, you have to make weight in order to fight for the belt.
- Loneliness puts you at risk for heart disease.
I... I should let her know I'll be late.
- your language?
That ain't good for the others.
And there are a lot of guns out here.
These are different.
Where is it?
She better not scratch it.
- Well, that would happen to be the love cry of the Pavo Cristatus,
Come on. You just climbed a beanstalk.
An absentminded attention.
So, you want me to help you? Yeah, we do.
It's really... [sighs]
Mr. Petrie asked you quite intrusive questions - about your father.
- Nail him! - Oh!
No, I don't. He's just a classmate.
The mayor's announcement comes amid growing concern, believe it or not, about zombies.
No, it's always him.
Yeah, it's got to be a seafood restaurant 'cause of that fish tank, which, by the way,
Um, at 9:37 last night,
Where are you?
I am now, am I?
Is Evan ready to go?
Which seems to be Zoe's style these days.
Well, she's very special.
And you want her to get better?
Donna and Yaron have made these videotapes to help couples stay in love.
But it would be way faster and more stable if you can just wait until after this database migration is done.
Cooper must be here.
- No, that wouldn't even be fair.
Mom, I punched a girl in the face two weeks ago.
So... you doing all right?
We help each other carry it, I guess.
Is that what it was?
Such as, a system which does not appear on Imperial charts but is represented in the art of the ancient people of this sector.
It would be nice if they sold.
Please, he needs...
A devastating global firestorm he's studied for more than 20 years.
I didn't... I didn't realize that you hadn't...
Beth, I'm talking about you.
Wh... wait, what? [stammers]
I'm pleased to hear from you.
Add lead levels to his blood work.
Exterminator can't come in till tomorrow.
Unless it was a lie.
Now the entire factory will have to be sterilised.
I'm so sorry.
He confirmed it.
I'm an executive consultant with Camila's company. Executive.
- My pleasure, Eddie.
I think that might be best.
- By who?
I still have a lot to learn because I'm really screwing up this one.
- Hello. - Whoa.
Paramedics are en route, but he seems relatively unscathed.
Is it short for something?
No... look, I'll call you when I've got the gun. Alright?
I mean it, Jenkins.
Raven is in danger.
No, I just... maybe it was just, like... just like a moment, you know?
- Oh, I got to call your wife.
And you, get us...
We want Amado.
Okay, how is that?
You know what's worse?
If it's right, you'll feel it in your soul.
How could Borden do this? Have we got an APB out on his car?
He's got a stellar career ahead of him.
And what it's done to it is, all the way down at the scale of a crystal, - is it's actually deformed it... - Mm-hmm.
You're clearly gonna join some lame horse-riding club and bring all of that nonsense back with you.
What should I do?
What do you call that one?
Let's step outside.
That's an unexpected development.
Be careful, with blood sugar is not joking.
Oh, I assure you, I have not.
I'm like you guys now.
What's your business with Lola Buckley?
You and Pin?
It wasn't about the house.
In the last week, their leader was murdered in a deal gone bad.
[sighs] Boden's with... oh. Okay.
Dobbs, we got to get better at spotting tails.
- We work for you!
Who do you think told them where it was?
They're bored. Their standards of entertainment are low.
Say you'll get the guns back on your own.
'It's not your house, it's not your business.
Are you sure they came looking for them?
Debbie's aunt gave us the... The necklace, told us to hold on to it.
I'm just trying to survive, man.
This place is rockin' and a-sockin'!
JP Looneys, Charlie Fitzwhiskey's.
Now, what type did you find on the barrel of the weapon which the police say was used to kill Rhys Jones?
Easy. Who are you?
You didn't send me a text yesterday?
Oh, no, sorry, I was thinking more along the lines of a field test.
And how many hospitals are you visiting?
This one says that every time I go out.
Recently went through an acrimonious divorce about a year ago.
We can keep this party going all night long.
- You can't see...
- That's your first hadrosaur, yeah?
I'm 100 percent sure.
All right, I'm gonna get him out two years early, which is still five years from now.
Why do I have to do that?
Oh, and just for fun, what would happen if it stayed on for, say, I don't know, 17?
Zoe don't live in Rochdale no more.
I thought you were taking care of the team.
I keep thinking about you.
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
Something you took?
You only say that because you haven't seen the bus I rented.
- He is plaintiff number 18 in our class.
But I'm okay. Totally okay.
It's actually science.
It was Borden.
It was no accident.
So get it back.
Yeah, I bumped into Selwyn this morning and said he should join us.
I want you to understand what you've done.
You're just so amiable.
One, two, three.
And a fifth.
Fair point. But your little brother... what's his name again?
So, we hopped in the car and sailed down there... and where they were digging was in the back of the cemetery.
All prisoners return to your cells.
Did your old boss ever let you do interviews?
Better him than me.
You jammed the audio with your phone.
Ovni and I will stay here, keeping you company.
He's not supposed to.
He said he can't find Reddington.
Top Dog! Top Dog!
Yes, I've confirmed your suspicions.
Why such a foul odour when it's a new corpse?
There, back against the wall, right beneath our nation's military flag.
Don't be ridiculous, it's stuffed.
It eats away at your reasoning and then your body.
I'd take that.
I'm not gonna let him get away with this.
- I mean, there's Zack.
- I'm Benny.
Mm-hmm, but just so I know in this particular scenario,
Everything's in the front closet.
No, no, no, it's not that.
I had never thought about it.
- I ran someone over.
You know what to do.
-Uh... Nothing, just some old toys.
Well, if they're bad, don't we want to keep them in the dark?
All I could do was work at part-time jobs every day to save money to get out of there.
Thank you for waiting around.
Yes, and I thought he had.
M.E. says they all died from blunt force trauma.
Rosie, are you in here?
Eight bullets pulled out of the wall, two in the toilets and six out in the bar.

We used to call Jonjo one of the special ones.
Please, before it's too late.
It seems like all I do is work.
Must've been an explosion.
I can't do no more.
That's why the newbie ordered that prison to be built.
I know you saved my life.

I'm scared, Harvey.
Lola, Chelsea, I just want the gun!

Yeah, I'm fine, OK.
Well, if you didn't, you should have.
Looks like we got our work cut out. Huh?
I called the doctor, panicked.
Do you want to talk about that?
I feel more like a hobo than a husband and a father. Oh, I understand that.

With one year of inactivity, it's extremely difficult being who you were... because you become civilized.
What the fuck?
Strange. Last night I had a dream I expelled the three of you. Hmm.
Are you coming, Chelsea?
- What? - The boob.
What did they think?

What she didn't realize was he was scouting his opponents before the game even started.
But how could he possibly know that?

...they're still there.
You pay the bills, Mr. Dowd.

I think it's worth it. Yeah.
I have to get him home.
So enjoy your final days of freedom.
Connor, I'm fine.
One for each of us, which I negotiated with the landlord.

Do I know you?
Oh, what is this, raspberry mint?
I'm staying with my grandpa.
And that wasn't because I was doing any drugs or anything. It's just I had so much going on in my life.
I can do it.
What are they doing all the way out here?
- You remember that new prisoner, Iman? - Mm-hmm.
How nice to finally meet you.
And nobody tried to stop it.
You did know him.
We were just kidding around, and... next thing I know, she's there, screaming.
Okay. I love you.
It sounded like a fight.
Just a few more boxes. Okay.
And I was like, "Ah, maybe this isn't that hard."
We don't know enough yet.
- Hank, what are you doing?
This is it.
The photographer guy must have been working with them.
Stone's operatives were able to hack into city infrastructure.

I didn't want her to go, but we felt that it's safer for me like this.
Of course it did.
We're too late.
All right, Adam, Kev, you guys go see - if Jo Jo's willing to talk.
We get in a taxi and we get to the hotel.
How can you be sure?
- Did you talk about my dad's balls? - What?

That's not exactly true.
You passed out just for a couple seconds, - but we're out of the woods now.
And we don't know what we're gonna find.
Alex Aufiero was murdered tonight.
- Have you been drinking?
What are you?

It's not a good day."

A lot of places overdo that.
You want to know? Yeah.
The other came in from reality like me.
That's got to be a record.
Nah, we'd just get in the way.
You surely like books.
Stay with him.
What is the meaning of this?

I just need a good night's sleep.
They're... they're circling back.
I was one of the original investigators.
I mean, it cost me my career.
You should have told me this before.
I've no idea how that got here.
Just one of the most powerful men in Boston.
Just so we're clear... no more letters or phone calls, yeah?
You have also earned the gratitude and respect of this department.

You need to tell me everything.
His brain is constructing a false narrative.
Let's see if you're as ugly as I remember.
So, you're gonna slap a special consultant badge right here on my chest and you're gonna take me in there with you, or your captain's gonna hear about how you stormed Reiden Tower and then disposed of key evidence via mail drone.
Do you think he will?
Would you take out your MetroCard please, Mr. Holt? Do not do that.

This is Coma.
You're a lifesaver.
He wants to push me out.
- Please, tell me you have that research saved to a cloud somewhere.
But where would they take him?
This time of night, that keycard, you can roll me right out.

It's his wife.
But honestly, that's nothing new.
Wolves don't get rattled.
You think I know where she is?
Just stay with me.
There are extenuating circumstances.
I was afraid you'd ask that.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

- I need copies of the abusive messages.
My day was going so well.
Did he name the crib?
Probably most kids wouldn't have questioned him, but... I just let it go.
- Can I hold her?

You know, I mean, because, honestly, you don't know me from Adam.
I spoke to Doctor Roberts and I put a call in to the Medical Examiner's office.

That's a little over-dramatic, sir.
Have you spent anytime in the Southwest recently?
Only three months after her wedding,
What is that?
You and Ricky snuck in? Yeah.
Within a government budget.
Go ahead, make jokes. I don't know why you think you're going to Comic-Con...
And you are?
And I should have believed you.
Are you okay?
Excuse me, sir. - You're not supposed to be in here. - Hey.
Yeah. I have no more questions.
You got much bigger problems than explaining to your wife what you like to do to little girls, pal.

And that hurt those people who really did have a memory that they had repressed and then recovered.
- What's happening?
The NYPD called Rebecca's husband.
Let that motherfucker sweat it out - like I'm fucking sweating it out.
Because I don't want to go back to 1942.
So the allegations?
- All she did, Dr. Manning, was care for your patients.
Of course. I'm gonna go put this in the fridge. Okay.
Well, you better bloody hope none of the others find out.
Um, I guess because, um... when I'd wake up, your dad was the first person I thought of.
Yes, and I love them very much, Ryan.
But he just picked her up and dropped her into some filthy storm sewer.
Like ghost pony, you mean?
She works for me now we agreed.

Have a good night.
Did she ever complain about it?
I'll just be quiet. - Shush.
I can tell you his name, his address, his licence plate.
Let's take a look at you.
Just like Sudan wants them to.
- Yeah, I will, I will.
She's thinking about your brother.
He worked here.
- So Howard back Monday?
Well, now that the investigation is over, I need to let you know that after careful consideration... we won't be making the promotion permanent.

Anyway, I know it's a shot in the dark, but--
Look, Nicole was attacked and she was left for dead.
How hard did you try to make a different deal with her?
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

She acts all holier-than-thou, but she has the same number of holes as anyone else.
Lots of entrances and exits.

Get rid of her.
-See you later. -See you.
Well, it could have been a fake.
I don't think so.
We could be the last generation who knows how these work.
- Brought you something better than a cookie.
Blood work disintegrates. Weather washes things away.
Go, go! Shut the door!
What are you talking about?
- What does the "H" stand for?
You'll never see us again.
Yeah, but I'll be better prepared this time.
- What do you mean?
But when I was halfway through the academy, they found out that I had omitted my family's arrest history.

I'm so sorry, Erica.
Honey, I want you to know that I am fully on board for you to attend Clayton Prep.
And I'm not surprised, because if I were you and a copper 'came round to my door, I'd want to hose them off the pavement. But...
It's a lot of bodies.
- Just a bloody bag lady.

You never were a very good student, Wonder Woman.
Can I help you, sir?
Second floor, apartment 25, end of the hall.
Mouch, he was drunk and acting crazy.
Let's talk about it later.
You will be notified when your sister has been cleared of the disease.

See you around, muskrat.
I'm gonna stock up on supplies.
- No, it's not.
It's just, Billie means a lot to me, you know?
What? I've got some steaks I've been wanting to throw on the grill.
We could lock her in that focus group room with the two-way mirror, keep an eye on her from in there.
- Thank you.
Let's not be afraid.
You really think she'd be okay with that?
I was trying to save them.
Take care of Jackson.

Please take these.
Krilov is a person of interest in a criminal investigation.

Excuse me, are you Detectives Reagan and Baez?
When do I leave?
Count to three.

And you never said anything.
Yeah, you're right.
Diane, this is Jeri Whittaker and, of course, Ashley Whittaker.
I could tell you didn't like us when we met.
Ronald Wilson Reagan!
What's on your mind?
You are out of here.
Okay, that's it. I want all firefighters to evacuate the building immediately.
And that's the thing.
Check it out, Zack.
She... is on another one of her trips for work... and you're the only one close to me.
Well, guess what.
Right in here.
- Sussing you out.
We can't stay down here.
Long time no see, old friends.
Now tell me this.
I worked just about all over Baltimore County.
Just let me fix this.
Hey Cougar, we're almost up to where you're at.
Oh, sure, sure.
Um, oh, well, because it was on loan to your grandma and grandpa just like they do with real art.
It's cheap as chips.
You could make it to the shipping lane, but once the monsoons hit, your boat is toast.
You are the lion prowling his savanna.
Sonia has no idea.
Not just for the rich and white!
- I'll give you a maybe.
You're all right, Jordy.
Oh, you missed it by that much.
You did good.
And I got really sick of not seeing justice done.
Only thing that makes me nervous is the prices in that menu.
The drone is losing altitude.
He doesn't have a motive and his alibi seems to check out.
Got ya! Ha-ha!
I think we're safe for the moment.
That hat looks good, by the way.
Yeah. Casey is getting recruited by that school Clayton Prep.
Roarke is widowed, so affairs are off the table.
I will hunt you jerks down!
How's Holly doing?
We think he's got the weapon there, but if we show up at his door, things could get ugly.
That was classic Dolly.
- Like a little crumpet or something.
What we did, it was nice.
What we're doing, it's right.
You said he was ready to cut a check. - Oh, well, what she should have told you, Jacob, is when you threaten someone with blackmail, you better goddamn be ready to defend yourself.

I mean, there's so much I need to teach him about what it means to be a Murtaugh man.
Sounds like you did the right thing.
I'm willing to bet that this gun matches the bullet that they pulled out of the victim in the bank.
He is. Oh, Evan drives? You drive?
So, where will you search next?
- Just keep your head down.
It's a chicken on roller skates.
But you read all my books and encouraged me.
Wow, how much Russian do you speak?
Is that the 14? 14 words?
Can you imagine the scientific possibilities?
Wait, hold on a second.
Since the analysis of the medicine came back with nothing we could identify, I decided to take a look at the capsule itself.
I find no use in looking at that scoreboard.
Be quiet. Don't move.
Where'd this come from?
You're really just living the high life now.
I was an orphan.
- Relax, Harvey, I'm not upset with you anymore.
-Where the hell is Canek?
Glad you brought that up.
So, I told McHugh that, yes, I... I believed her story.
- No, you broke your agreement when you had an affair for two months and you thought you were gonna leave her.
And this particular day, we'd had our photo call, so, you know, you shouldn't have been out with your camera any more.
It's an expensive system, so whoever knocked out those cameras had to have a certain level of technical sophistication.
For instance, how old is Leekie?
Now take my advice and get the fu... out of here.
Military and police forces have been dispatched...
Your little happy life is about to come crumbling down, Franky.
She's been through what the other girls have gone through, and more.
I didn't do it for you. I did it for him.
I'm not intruding on anything?
Throw it home, you piece of shit!
Yeah, a run for the presidency as I understand it.
He's currently with the leader of the flock, who knows nothing of his true identity.
Look, whatever happened in that room... it wasn't me, okay?
And here I was thinking that stealing and getting arrested were his only talents.
So, who has the gun?
But I see now that the sign was that I've got a gambling problem. Yeah.
I wanna go home!
- Man, do you hear yourself?
"Hope is being able to see that there is light, despite all of the darkness".

We need leads when Pride resurfaces.
Want to see him go crazy?
Anyone from his registry.
I can't believe it.
So how does this work now?

- Pay your respects.
Help my boy out so we can get back to the cha-cha.
You need to come with me.
Are we going to keep letting them treat us like idiots?
If you call this in, he's going to find me, hurt me.
SBK guys don't flip.
"Thank you for finding us." It just was overwhelming.
Oh, don't worry, he made us pinky swear we'd keep it a secret.
- She resigned.
Can't you just use a pencil and paper?
Why don't you call the front desk and see if we can get a DVD player going while I go change?
This isn't part of the agreement.
Jordan, got our results?
How are you gonna access it?
He brought it here to kill me.
- Like what?
Guy figured Kindler was an easy target, and the D.A. and PD would take him with open arms.
He was gonna give all of you up.
I mean with Mom and Dad.
That's the deal.
Always one glass of Merlot.
It makes my life harder where I live.
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?
Jill, we need your password now.
Elliot, who did this to you?
That's why I'm saying it.
Each time, friends of ours get killed, leaving us with fewer and fewer Fishers.
Caroline, this is Eddie.
Mixed with a little monkey business.
- You can fly. Why do you need a boat?
Do you have an appointment? No.
No. I just don't think your heart is breaking like mine is over the fact that we physically - can't be together.

Yeah, they're very popular amongst rappers 'cause they do equally well in Jacuzzis and champagne.
Man to man, and to the whole team, um, I'm sorry.
My heart goes out to all the people who've lost all their loved ones in the world.
It's a long way down.
All right, we've got to be subtle.
- We all need power.
I watched three men die and now I'm done with the CFD.
I'm sure she's fine.
But what if Nadine's right?
Well, we got a call from the caretaker... that the cops are down there, digging up the records.
Ok, I just have to say something.
Yeah. Yeah, I've noticed.
Come on, bud.
My partner and I noted that the description matched that of Dawn Osborn, who we had interviewed earlier.
He's the best.
But you know what's not in here?
Could mean a wiretap.
Played a little ball back in high school.
Well, I need to go and freshen up.
You might just be creating more trouble for yourself.
And, hopefully, we will get you home very soon.
We came on a medical distress call.
Talking involves listening, Gabby, and you're not doing that.
What happened? I thought your machine worked.
First, I couldn't tell if she was breathing.
They were very upset with that.
So, where's Ralph? I didn't say "hi" to him.
But... I need your help right now.
Yes, I can feel it.
I just need to know one thing...
I don't want Mama to come back.
I mean, there's still so much to do.
Once we get the truck patched up, we'll be on our way. - You boys need any help?
In that time together, did he ever mention having any issues with anyone?
We shouldn't tell Charlie tonight.
Are you out of your mind?
- No. I'm leaving.
We can take advantage that the news of Quintero's arrest is fresh out of the oven.
No, it's a way of life and it's a philosophy.
But those files are designated SCI7.
We've got to move fast. Okay, Chip, open it up.
You're gonna be all alone at your hearing.
- They're like $50, though.
Go away, Blake.
On my ass.
Like you said, you and your husband fought.
Yeah, I seem to recall you trying to kill her and snow.
Then left it again. Mad at them, probably.
I guess all I remember was going in, you know... thinking more I was going to show support and we were going to give Jeanie a chance to tell what happened.
Both slugs match.
Ralph's education continued unabated.
He didn't tell me one.
Just as soon as you fix it back up.
Okay, so you host a cupcake show.
I only just managed to convince him not to call the police.
Who are they calling a leader?
That's more than enough.
Tensions between Russia and NATO are already at an all-time high.
Sorry for being such a jerk about that.
- Who did you pay, Mr. Creary?
I'm so mad at you right now.
I hope you understand that the warehouse must remain in the custody of the Secretariat of National Defense.
It is strange.
She's like a big sister to me.
- you're just...
- Yeah. - Wait a minute, bud. You can't compare us to Napa.
I didn't mean to break off all communication, I just... I had to figure out how I was feeling.
- I beg your pardon?
Not in person, not on the phone.
- I wasn't blaming you.
Look, I'm back this afternoon. Can we discuss it then?
Oh, I'm gonna be mad.
I ever tell you the story about my dad?
People deal with grief in different ways... ..and my way of dealing with it was... was by, basically, shutting it out, locking it out.
Research, supplies, payment.
It is not contained and it is dangerous.
If you could take a look at these and tell me if anything jogs your memory?
Look, I appreciate your suggestion about coming forward... with charges against Andrada.
Walt, Paige, eta.
You're gonna forget you ever heard 'em.
Walk me to my car?
Is that the last one?
And I didn't know what to do.
You made another hybrid.
You've been gone for ten years and nothing's changed.
This was the first step.
You're not leaving here until I know.
How is he ever gonna get comfortable around her if you won't let him get to know her?
She should've rented a cabin in Montana.
- that's all.
No, wait, I got this.
I think it's a reasonable strategy.
Well, I'm sorry you're doing so much building, but it's actually Sabrina who's being bullied.
We found the shredded pieces of your missive in New York's Sunset Park recycling facility.
- Owen get off to school OK?
I hope so.
I've been called a genuine medical oddity.
I don't know what you're talking about. Come on.
-So how long do we have?
Wonder what she was told to do.
And you're Kurt Zehnder, former member of the 8113.
That's great. Generally, though, I don't conduct council business while I'm on CFD time.
Tahir contacted us.
- I found this.
Have you got it yet?
- No, not really.
I was just enjoying my dinner.
I know, she was amazing.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, they'd, um... they just reckon it's a bit of indigestion, so they're keepin' her in medical for the afternoon.
Yeah, I mean, that's not the half of it.
Managing Jesse could be a huge payday.
I want to get back to the house, maybe take a nice, hot... shower.
You are so skinny!
Jackson has a lead on someone who might be Abigail's partner.
There's no need to call anyone.
Come on, Camila.
And, together, we can put an end to all this.
You're doing it!
He's got a gift, he does.
Only my dad calls me that.
- All they need is a name.
Enjoy the grouse.
All right. What do we do now?
You failed your friends.
- That's Camila's attorney.
She's the blow job queen. Piss off.
I'm praying for my sister Phoebe, praying for my mother, for myself.
I have an idea, but I will need your help to set up a neural link with the Ferrous Corp shuttle that's currently docked with the ship.
Ali is still a virgin.
Go ahead, do your job.
Hey, there, I'm Tuffy.
A chance isn't enough.
You used to win this every year, remember?
Can you stop breathing so loud?
Right, one more interview, one more blog, and I will make sure everybody knows how much you fucked this up.
Holly Winshaw had fallen out with her parents and was mostly living away from home when the sexual exploitation of her began.
He didn't ditch me. I ditched him.
- I really fancy a drink, maybe two.
Good night, Darius.
He said that Mara Tres was handling it.
He asked me to join him.
Now, police did interview that woman about the murder of Sister Cathy Cesnik and they believe that she is not connected in any way to the murder.
Their plan, once they arrived in Oregon, was to go to ground so Dr. Zanner could get to work on the biological weapon.
What the hell just happened?
Talk to me.
And there was one occasion in 1970, on Halloween night... my girlfriend was spending the night.
No, no, no.
Blah, blah, blah. Know what got me through it?
- It's Nagel now. - We grew up together.
Have you seen my car?
I want a deal first.
- I'm selfish, I know.
I'll admit, she's an amateur, but she's read hundreds of times more novels than we have.
M for murder.
He'll need emergency surgery.
I've been chewing this piece for eight solid weeks.
The crime scene's been officially processed.
We did this for you.
Uh, thanks for hanging in with me though all that.
Hey, where's Zoe?
Probably more your level anyway.
You don't think that Dawn Osborn was genetically predisposed to murder.
No, should I?
You and me, we're gonna rappel down either side of him.
I'm sorry we couldn't talk about this on the phone.
Your truck has no plates.
- Do you feel sick?
I must say, I'm surprised to see you here.
But that's the point, isn't it?
Yes! It could be a Marzaniok.
Hey, Nell, could you run down a Mallory Fletcher from Lindenmere Assets for us?
Guess who still gets to attend CCU?
You said that Morrison killed your father.
Allen Smith, Five-O!
the pink one with the hearts or the blue one with the polka dots?
Everything's on track. We'll be up and running in a few hours.
And what does this mean for you?
You might not be ready now, but you will be.
All right, cheerio, love.
The-It was called back then the CP Telephone Company.
Save us... or destroy us.
But this isn't about us.
I'm dying to know what you were gonna say.
It's just a tiff.
- A lot of bets coming in.
-Damn it. civil associations, the press.
I love seeing my girl's hair all shiny.
Adelie, chinstrap... I didn't mean to upset you. I wanted to...
Killers that meticulous, they don't get nervous.
- We're stuffed, Martha.
So, we go down there on the parking lot.
-How are you?
Start filling these.
- Oh, you're not who I thought you were.
Every little kick was like... a knife in my heart.
I ain't got no hate on him.
She's 18 years old.
Fuck the Freak!
And we're sitting side by side.
If I was lucky, I wouldn't have ended up here in the first place.
And anyone around the world doing a search - for zombies will find us?
I gave it away so we could escape.
I was foreman of a food-packing plant for 30 years.
That really hurt!
I got away.
How's my favorite horse whisperer?
I'm headed back to headquarters, to help them find that necklace.
Yeah. Four more years.
I appreciate your concern.
Like a dog.
Now, we need the department's final approval today, so, I want everyone on their absolute best behaviour.
Oh, man, I took some good naps on these camp beds back in the day.
You've reached my cell. Leave a message.
Right, what do you mean by that?
So, yesterday I went to his mother's house in New Rochelle.
Hey, can I help you?
Oh, my God, Mom.
200 miles off the coast.
That's why people trust them.
Did things to them...
It's ok. It's ok.
And one of the things we want to ask her is if you ever laid a hand on her during your marriage.
Thanks for this. Take a seat.
Look, Jamie is the person that I trust most.
I wouldn't talk this over with the wife.
The riverbed changes a lot.
Why are we still waiting for the search warrant for Dr. Marr's?
Sheldon, this is silly. You can't expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this.
What's happened, Lola?
And your blood pressure's on the high side.
"My beloved Torey, you are my most precious thing in this world.
- Love some.
It's not important.
More or less.
Well, I think the pink one with the hearts.
May processions were a big thing,
Why don't we just... move somewhere where there are no nuclear plants?
Mm, she's also highly manipulative and potentially dangerous.
So, Desmond... do you have any idea how far from the shore you are?
What's so funny?
Where's my son, you bastard?
I need you to listen - to what I have to say.
I wanted to protect you.
- Yeah, yeah.
I've had to do all this county paperwork myself.
You're still a good father.
They were all out of that at the market.
No, I looked at it for both of us.
I don't accept that.
He live-streams pretty much every day.
Well, they both have kids for him.
Dr. Shore, Dr. Halstead, don't forget...
- It's been a couple of days. - I wanted to see how things are going.
Nothin' boss... just leavin'.
Oh, right. Because of this.
Thank you for your time.
She's getting bullied!
I might have known.
Can anyone really talk to Weller besides Jane?
Chela wants you to go.
- Wait a second.
So how much of those two months do you actually remember?
In case Joan hasn't mentioned it, the op went well.
Oh, my God.
They hard-wired an explosive device into the RV's electrical system.
A Christian and a Muslim walk into a bagel store?
Oh, I see it.
This isn't something that I am trying to get away with, Harvey.
We've never met, but Dean Donovan at the SFS sings your praises.
I know it was risky to leave and speak to my dad.
Is that all you've got?
Vera, tell your boss not to worry.
I had no idea. I had no idea.
Oh, don't underestimate the power of short wave radio, Mr. Callen.
You want to skip town? I'll drive the car.
Find Ed for you.
That's good. That's a good thing.
No, no, he was here, wandering around as usual.
So a massive barrier was constructed, to protect the rest of North America, but new breeds have started to appear, so we reassembled our team.
Sam Hanna, NCIS.
She'd been trying to clean up that Meachum fallout for years.
Can you describe him?
I was just afraid, just too afraid.
From now on, you follow Toño's orders.
As quickly as you can and send it to Dembe.
I couldn't forgive my wife or that man.
I can't say that I'm surprised though.
- Gina? - Hey, Joe.
All clear in here.
We don't need Sam if we can voice synth enough dialogue to fool Tahir.
I love you more than anything, and I've never been so proud of you.
We're being hunted.
The Tiffanys are coming to town!
What are you doing up here?
If it is in this prison, I want that shifter found, preferably before it's used to part someone's hair.
Whoa. Where's the fire, girl?
I'm wondering why you didn't use the gate.
Can't help you.
- Right. - And they don't see the traditional boxer.
I have to go.
What do you need to get to the bottom of this?
His new work is coming out soon, so he just might be.
Oh, thorium reactor.
No matter how far an albatross flies, it always returns home.
"The light will come through again. Love, Mama."
What on earth are you doing?
It's not my handwriting.
Maybe it's Dad.
I was just hoping to talk to your dad for a minute.
Frank? Spin the lug wrench as fast as you can.
I'm right on time.
- Now, what did she want?
So, if this is who we're going after, what's the best angle?
Well, right now, it's all about making sure her psychosis is under control and her meds are dosed appropriately.
Look around, ladies.
But you're funny and pretty, and I like the way you pinch your nose when you sneeze.
I know you can hear me!
I don't understand why we have to keep going over this.
I gotta let the plumber in my apartment.
Okay, we get it!
- Figured he should have an adult with him.
He's in Philly.
And they build someone's record to make them look like a great, undefeated boxer.
Those are knockando holes.
I'm gettin' an abortion.
Just do... Just be all over the place.
Uh, Noah had requested the boy's juvenile criminal file, but JAGs can't access a minor's record without a court order.
If she gives us consent to use it. And right now...
Well, where's future Sebastian now?
Hold me back.
So what begins?
That Kaz, she's like, she's all talk and no action...
You've been dead to me for ten years.
Negative, it's not on here.
Type "girl poops pants at spelling bee."
Hurry, up here!
Are you sure this is going to work?
Jonjo was our friend.
And, erm, you've gotta maintain er, a barrier and a boundary, er, because if you cross it, if both sides cross it, erm, a lot of pain and problems can come from it.
This is my job now!
That's a barely blunted neurotoxin... it's barbaric.
It's not what I agreed with your associate.
Things are too hot right now.
Utility closet? I don't care.
This is an absolutely amazing event - mountains the size of the Himalayas were formed in seconds.
And that was the extent of it. Um...
- Good idea. - Mm-hm.
I have other daughters.
Oh, you win.
What's worse, death by family, or being crushed by that?
What if I help?
The police and fire department are working to identify the body...
We got a winner.
Listen to me.
I think I do.
- Ah, well, yes, but...
There's three people we're doing this for: the family.
The leader of the Warrior Kings is already in prison.
But as no-one can confirm this, that doesn't mean that one of them didn't return to the harbour to lie in wait for Tom to arrive.
She killed Detective Kaplan, Miss Bennett.
Don't you worry, lad.
- A pretty damn huge one.
I'm sure we can work something out.
Is not now and never has been.
I appreciate it.
Well, I was.
I need to see Carn Mohr for myself.
- Mrs. Swagger, I am sorry to report the airport is still closed.
Just bang it out. Get rid of it.
Tricyclics plus cocaine, and Fentanyl triggered the clonus.
- Slow down.
- Care to be more specific?
Let me have a look at you.
He'll be here tomorrow.
The girl is putting herself and the child at risk.
- Deborah Kaplan.
His gang name was Socks.
Look at me. It's me.
All I hear is Simcoe!
I'm gonna go put an end to this.
We need suction, now!
Thank you... for taking care of Laz for all of these years.
If it helps them help themselves, then great, but a little cooperation with cops might be a better way.
This isn't a normal threat.
Well, that would explain why the van didn't show up on any of the highway cams.
I just never wanted anybody to touch me.
You don't get rid of the rot by cutting off a branch.
My wife and kids don't know my real name.
-We can ask them where the hell Mosca is.
It's an idea that means he will be there with us.
My guards will find me soon.
I've hurt a lot of people, Maria.
It gives Tannetti time to change her plea.
She wants you to give her a call.
Come on, I didn't do nothing.
You know, I actually, uh, had a lot of questions about the day that she died.
- Harvey, I dropped the suit because you asked me to.
No, that's not how it happened.
Aren't we all?
That's like a bat-ugh.
I mean, unfortunately, I didn't realize I was a coach until almost ten years ago, you know.
- I have a way out.
- No one's avoiding anyone.
Eighty per cent sure isn't good enough, then, from this boy?
All children deserve protection but there are people like me and Dr Millar, Father Ross, even Matron, who you are safe with.
She's always voted the most popular by her fans.
And all those things are colliding with each other into a big pile of "people hate Harvey."
And that's when you say he attacked you in the car.
There is some underlying condition.
This isn't how the book's supposed to end.
You might tell your friends to quit pointing those guns at me?
They're personally escorting it to the morgue now.
Thornton versus McGregor, fight three.
but keep it quiet.
- Is it what?
We became canonical novices, which meant that we were cloistered.
- I never agreed to that.
If you see me turn into that guy, put a bullet in my head.
- This is exactly what Harvey needed.
Since the guys on the other side are trying to rip us off and think we don't know.
I get foreclosure notices from the city.
I WISH YOU HAPPINESS. (LAUGHING)
He's way too nervous for a little press conference like this.
It's not right what happened.
But it gives me great pleasure to announce that this year's winner is...
Pin it is.
I am locking this building down.
What you did was unforgivable!
Knock yourself out.
You deserve back in.
What for? You're a brilliant mum!
What I want is to stop having to cover for you.
Sorry, girls, enjoy the sitcoms and shoulder pads.
So, would you say his mane was long and scraggly, or pristine and well kept?
That's why they give them numbers.
First, see how I'm entering her.
I think it's best if you find a new work unit.
Hey, guys, I need your help with something.
Okay. Wait, what were you gonna tell me?
You want to be upset at him, be my guest.
Do you love them too?
These guys will not be afraid to come after you.
Let me know when you are ready to take off.
What are you doing up?
I didn't just get born, Raymond.
And you do not let him fall.
Why do you think I walked all the way over here?
♪ For another cup of wine ♪
Believing Smurf gave a shit about me.
Hey, I, uh, I also got you a little something.
How much do you love me?
I wanna bring a team to Vegas.
Amy, get up.
I didn't mean to kill my son.
Unless he can prove the existence of a deal, he has nothing.
Brought out 11 bodies so far.
I mean, if she is going to hide something, it would be...
She might be able to help.
That's A-plus material for sure.
DNA from a frog and put it into a T. Rex, like a little mini Jurassic Park, you know what I...
Look at that thing, Claire.
You do realise, Miss Poussin, that making a false declaration is a very serious matter?
Mmm, not so professional.
-I just need to talk to her.
Now, according to the file I read, she killed your father.
It's a crime.
Until this is resolved, you and I should be very careful about what we say or do.
- In the back?
If Russia takes Bulgaria, they'll be in Poland by Christmas.
I'm getting a patchy neurosync again, just like last time.
And there were maggots in her face.
I hardly had any contact with her.
THEY ARE BOTH YES AND NO.
I'm not so sure.
So... how long are you here for?
What's that to you?
Tell your sister what you did.
And you just belittled me and embarrassed me in front of all of them.
You're not riding Raven.
SBK isn't my gang.
But I don't think the real murderer has achieved his objective.
It's difficult to teach this business to those whom you love.
We've nicknamed him Deep Throat from the... from the old Watergate inside source.
No. Kill me.
Now we just need to find the ignition coil.
Read the question.
What time is it?
Look how sharp he is.
You don't give up.
He thinks Reddington's feeding Keen intel on criminals. That in exchange, she's keeping him a step ahead of us.
Do you understand me?
I don't know, I didn't feel safe working with him anymore.
It's very evident when you look at the pictures that they look distanced from each other, even to the point where they're walking down a staircase, both walking down a separate set of stairs, and there's a wall in the middle,
Could be occluded.
I can probably get my hands on out there.
In that case, Nanaka... I have a little favor to ask you.
Yeah, she disappeared in 1991, just dropped off the grid.
Like he had no filter.
You'd have met him, one way or another.
It sounds like a problem between three-letter agencies.
I can't walk no more.
- if I talked to him about... - You know what?
-Do you want me to leave?
I know, but James invited me to his house in the country for a few days.
Sergeant John Brossette, U.S. Marine Corps.
Nice to meet you in person, finally.
I was always wanting to be locked up and I didn't care if I was ever rescued or not.
Humans can't be perfect, because we're not machines.
You three will hide nothing.
That is exactly what we need.
And that's typical pedophile.
Concerned about what?
What is your point, sir?
So, what can I do?
It's been that way for years.
It's a stasis tank.
You are not serious right now.
How's, uh... how's London?
I have to go away for a couple of days.
It's crazy that something so interesting won't sell!
I needed to come back.
- Ah, glad to have you.
I'm just being honest about market value.
Couple of homeless guys, and you froze them while they were still alive.
DPP are withdrawing the charges.
Yeah, you're right. You're way more screwed.
Mr. Michima, if an author becomes conflicted, he cannot offer a clear conclusion to his readers.
How many more?
I spoke to him.
- Yes, I do.
They're still down on Cathedral Street.
Wh... you're crating up the Dollhouse?
Why should I tell you?
What the fuck is this?
How the hell did these things cause a volcano to erupt?
Doesn't give us a connection to Brossette, but... But it could give us Reznik if he's going back to the hospital.
It's being taken care of.
No, no. Lying to you this morning.
She acted like she didn't know, but yet her face said she did know.
And he lived inside his head.
Liz, we're ready.
That's... that's awesome.
Previously on The Last Man on Earth...
When she broke up with me.
Top Dog! Top Dog! Top Dog!
I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you.
I just think, "How could you do that to us?"
Once to douse his bullet, and another time after he was dead, to relieve him of Turnleaf's bank records.
No one could survive a jump from that height.
Yeah, I would give her everything that she wanted anyway.
Once I access the server, it'll be about 15 seconds before the backup generators activate, all right?
Say, "Nate, come with me to 1942."
Were you boys just talking about me?
We can do this.
That would be nice.
Good place for an exchange.
Why isn't he calling?
I know you knew Frankie Belmont.
Maskell called my father and told him that I'd have to see a gynecologist and that he knew Dr. Christian Richter.
Now that we know he killed Jameel Clark, it shouldn't.
No, Your Honor.
So this is the end of the line for me.
I'm sure we could work this out.
- She was never pregnant.
Three and a half days until we're out of coconuts.
MAYBE GOOGLE IT?
Being a sanctuary city is high on the mayor's list of priorities.
HAVE YOU GIVEN UP ALREADY?
You need some change?
You were able to look past the things that I had done before I came to the FBI.
- Don't die.
We work together when our boss tell us to.
You go find the others.
Oh, I'm gonna get another.
You having a party?
But that's a city building.
The guy had a concealed weapon.
There's the actor with the hat and the newscaster with the scarf and the actor with the hat.
Well, maybe she just lost it.
The depositions were...
No, no, no, no, no.
Whatever she says.
She bombed us the same day that we found the new hybrid.
Tell you what, he might be the toughest guy I've ever met.
You look like one of them.
Not to be a stickler for detail, but I've actually proposed three times, if you count the very romantic version I did while you were in a coma.
It's possible Dr Millar may pursue a job in London.
It's meant to be a gentle death, like drowning.
But what they're starting to reveal about the force of the impact is literally earth-shattering.
I am what stands between you and them.
- Hello, ladies.
Come on, buddy, you look like Ryan Gosling's ugly step-brother.
The main reactor's on fire...
Rosie... what is it?
You understand? Zoe?
And a tiny group of animals came out of hiding to inherit the Earth.
Hey. You heading home?
Okay, we're good.
Okay, I'll be in touch.
We were going to kidnap your son tomorrow.
You hit him over the head with the statue and placed his body in a tub of lye?
Out of all of the people in New York, God has chosen me to put you in front of the masses. It is humbling, really.
If she had died, your novels would have sold even more.
Or on our end.
Listen, I remember catching the tail end of you talking to my partner when he told you that we caught the guy who did it.
- What's the name?
I will, okay?
My God, the humidity.
You... you think she's going to die.
Someone broke into it.
Is it accurate?
He was so good.
Well, we need to dig into the old case, but if I remember right, Chief Decker testified against Gordon at the trial, claimed he was unstable.
Tell them, Kallus! It's her! She's the one!
If he did, he wouldn't have looked like that.
You tell me.
We're expecting a major heroin shipment, due to arrive in New York any day.
Right. (LAUGHS) You're in the tummy.
I'd better get Bob to the field before the drama gets to his head.
The "Star Wars" falcon thing.
- Yeah, OK.
I think Darcy needs a bath.
Here I had you pegged as a hubby, five kids, living in a Brownstone in Lincoln Park kind of gal.
Get back here.
I know why you're here.
Well, we're still determining just how accidental.

Charybdis was a whirlpool that could destroy them all or they might all make it through.
Look out, world, Bob's coming for you.
This is our last stand.
I don't even know if he's gotten the message.
He tortured him.
They were the only ones that Marjory dealt with directly.
- doing in my kitchen, huh?
I lost the signal.
And that's it?
As a kid, I used to dream about the title.
Pride! - Pride!
Wait a second.
- 30 years ago, no one really knew why Ronald Jones shot up the courthouse where his wife worked, but Grandpa Leonard always had a sneaking suspicion.
Maybe we did, I just don't remember that.
Why the hell would I be looking for that?
The IO Probe.
Apparently, it goes back generations.
Yeah, I don't know, guys.
Do you think he might be...
Turn your feelings on and off like that, like a robot.
- (thunder rumbles)
Tonight, we're gonna have a real banquet.
Oh, guys, I wanted to take a moment to say that it's so great to have you all back.
I mean, you know,
I've spent my life trying to answer that.
I feel bad.
It doesn't sound like she knew what was going on.
Look, I'm gonna go get cleaned up.
- Thank you.
I crack it, it's 50-50 they get a trach tube in you in time.
Every single thing he expects of us, we have to do.
What do you want?
Don't come here.
We got two victims, one child, one adult, both red.
So he'll just get away with it, then?
Everyone from Janet Yellen to Jay Z.
And I want to give a very special thanks to a wonderful gal, Julie Levinson, a graduate student at Juilliard School, who gave a bravura performance as Renata, the psycho nanny.
We have a code six.
It concerns our engagement party.
Then you won't mind indulging me in this little exercise.
Well, it may seem progressive to you, Andrew, but I don't see it working in this environment.
It can't live in the air, which is why we gave the okay to let you out of quarantine.
I know if I got in a fight... and he was riding with me as a chaplain, he'd be there by my side.
Yeah. I'm leaving.
That was mild?
I arrived a short while ago to test a theory.
No wonder you ran away with Owen.
OK? He just - he just cut us off... cold.
It's a case.
All right. I got to tell you, buddy... that was well done.
Works the boats.
- good... I'm great... I'm...
Don't touch anything.
He's over there!
Even 11 years after his death, his works still sell better than all of ours.
I think this is the right thing to do.
- Absolutely not.
you don't try anything stupid.
She's gonna lead 'em here. It's an old oil refinery.
WILLIAM: Can I grab a seat here?
I decided to trust someone.
And perhaps his brother, for that matter.
- Little Logan?
I like dangerous men.
It's a bad dream. Come on.
San José, Costa Rica?
Bethan McGrellish's dad.
DIRECTOR: How do you keep her memory alive for your children?
When did I have a normal life?
Heart rate 112.
Thanks, everyone, for coming down here today and chipping in on the pancake breakfast.
I know you all trusted me. I jeopardized your job...
- Sorry for that.
Are you okay?
But why intercept and kill the other two?
If they know I'm still alive and they can't find me, they're gonna go after my parents.
You know that's not true.
How far would you go to protect your child?
And Garcia pinged it?
That is completely unnecessary.
Well, I'll get by.
She was around here a couple of hours ago.
Congratulations, Mrs Dalton.
Thirded. I don't feel so good.
Other than that, still looking for the coroner's vehicle.
I'd want blood.
Uh-uh, we do that, they'll assume Pride kidnapped the mayor.
She was the most helpful person I've ever met.
But I just got hold of him, and I I kept saying to him, "Just stay with me. Stay with me, baby."
That is the girl with whom you had a sexual relationship, is it not?
Chop, you see that? It's gone.
Gates are opening. Water's rushing into the canal.
It was a man's voice.
So what did you do, then?
I need to know that she's all right.
Transcendence is magnificent, isn't it?
No, no. Don't, don't, don't.
Looks like the suction's got 'em.
- Oh, you're a howler, huh? - Uh-huh.
Once I got past your desert boots.
- That was before I found this... and this... and this. - Holy shit.
You can do that in San Antonio.
Now, we're pretty sure he was after the same prize that you were, and now he's dead.
(chuckles) I forgot.
Who is it?
So we're not looking for an artifact.
Yeah, he's hanging in there.
I don't know what she looks like now.
This is what happened over and over and over again.
And I said Mass.
What are you trying to do?
So, what can I get you in exchange for those documents?
Call 911 for Christ's sakes!
But they acknowledge that so-called "graduates" take on side jobs mentoring other men.
- What's goin' on?
They aren't after that, they're coming after us!
And as you'll recall, their falling-out was quite public-- staged ones often are.
Yes, sir. Al's the best in business.
I have provided you with an opportunity.
I want to shake your hand, soldier.
Now that we know we're good... Okay, is that it?
I lost a battle so you could win the war.
I think she'd be proud that
Copy that, 5021 George.
Son of a bitch.
Well done, Teresa.
No, this has nothing to do with hook.
And you was so much in the fucking moment all the time that you...
Don't believe everything you hear on the news.
I know she did it, and she's gonna get away with it.
- Good luck.
See you guys.
He found a way to get close,
No, I didn't mean that.
I'm a CIA agent.
Where is the child?
If I could see him in person, I might be able to convince him.
Hey, I don't really look like a Hollywood type to you, do I?
There are more shops than that... in jail.
Thank you, both.
Hey, it's a girl.
I miss him to this day.
Not this one.
Santa's Little Helper didn't come home last night.
That's precisely what you'll do and it's non-negotiable.
Okay, first thing I'm gonna need is super glue to hold the artery together.
-Yes, it leaves me out.
This is total bull jizz!
Should I set a place for Bob Lee?
Y'all don't think I'm gonna find out who?
Let this be a lesson to you, dear reader.
Kids use it to party, but nobody's gonna be there at dawn.
- Bethan, what have you done to her?
And you need to learn to respect the wishes of the Horse Thief Hero.
Confined to a wheelchair, hooked up to a ventilator.
Thanks for coming.
Veruca, are you all right?
Hang on, please.
Sure you don't want to wait in the car?
But if you look at the 25 fighters he fought, they're literally nobodies.
They're just bush league, okay?
What did he do?
You see these?
[chuckles] [Katie] Come on, Andy!
No, no, no, no, no! He'll kill us, too, if we don't go now. Where's tulip?
I mean, of course, Russell Wilson being an exception.
Evidence had been tampered with.
You can make fun.
It's the only upside to a tragedy on the block.
Particularly since he wrote some unflattering stories around the Beijing Olympics and was asked to leave the country.
You're still up, Hitomi?
Hey, looks like the gang's all here.
Get them off of me!
- Look at us, everybody!
I don't disagree.
In all honesty, there was just a second I thought:
They said I might have some dizziness over the next few days.
Being obsessed with Katie was Coop's defining character trait.
- He'll probably knock on the door in a minute.
The President wants to speak to you.
We have already doubled our investment.
Feed that bullshit to someone else.
Yes, the evidence that he was behind the stolen weapons is significant, but it's still circumstantial.
That's where ECO PRO+ sets the maximum speed, because that way you get the maximum range.
- You had a vision of them together? - No.
We'll walk along the Seine and wear matching berets and eat baguettes.
I believe people have the right to be conflicted and be troubled.
Yeah, I love you, too, sweetheart.
So, we were hoping to get 1,500 metres, but we've got 700 metres of peak ring materials, so we're pretty happy.
Not "just," no.
The rules in here are different.
His pancreas is compromised and his kidneys are failing.
I know she was important to you.
He said, "Don't worry about it."
"Workers take down the scaffolding..."
Do you need my help with your lawsuit?
- It's a free bar and you know it.
Yup, her head's at this end.
I'm totally innocent of anything That's... that they're accusing me of.
Oh, look. He's on some charity softball team.
Believe me, that was not what I had imagined for myself as a young girl.
Okay, so we won't talk.
You see what she's trying to do?
If there's any indication that someone broke in recently, I will call you guys.
I think the answer's quite simple.
I was out for a run.
- So, we take it to the cops.
-They want me to jump in! -What?
He's reaching for something.
Iman attended that course,
What's going on?
It's a rental.
And I bet you could do better now.
This could be over.
Well, take your time.
For too long, we've put our faith in corrupt leaders and a rigged system.
I don't understand.
- Donna... - Rachel, you were right.
- That's all I know.
Yeah, which is precisely why our killer is on the verge of making major league millions.
So that's the way you want to play it, quick and easy?
But you have to at least talk to him.
Joan's going for your job?
A degenerate. She refused to take Cora in.
He looks quite thin.
- He already knows.
SINS NEVER DISAPPEAR! IT'S WHAT YOU DESERVE!
Sometimes, when you overthink things, you get confusing.
Well, see that's the thing... silence is golden.
Did you talk to Dolores?
It feels good to finally be free of that secret.
Keep us posted. Yeah.
Well, since we're on that topic,
That's your problem.
Proof of transfer five million dollars into your account, as promised.
That's our first, best, and last offer.
This was definitely a mistake.
Can you get another?
Because either Flynn was lying to me about who killed my wife, or he wasn't, and fate wanted her dead anyway.
- So, what did you tell her? - Just that we lived on this street.
You got it in his head so he'd go along with your crazy ideas.
- All right. I'll talk to Narcotics, see if they can look into it.
At the time we filed our suit, Archbishop Keeler was up to become a cardinal.
You go ahead.
HARRY: It was very, very strange after her death, you know, the sort of...
This is the Traceworks.
You're gonna shoot me?
- I'm taking you home.
You don't call 911 and then stay in the house as it's burning down.
Well, I'm so sorry to hear that, Will. And I wanted to wish you the very best.
As you wish, Amado.
Okay, look, the me that cares about you really hopes.
I'm just saying, let's do it again.
I don't know anything!
Why murder 5 people just to kill one husband?
One of the elite ones.
But remember, it's temporary, okay?
Anyway, please take this. If anything happens, you remember something... I don't know, anything...
My father's death sentence had been carried out.
No one will know you helped me. They won't even know I was here.
Well, I really enjoyed preparing these bright, bold flavors for you today.
I didn't put it down because...
Uh, look, I would love to help you with your scary horse,
Can I have coffee?
They put me in cuffs.
- Thank you.
- Well, yeah, we figured.
Okay, um, I think I'm ready to rule on this motion.
- We're not going to make it.
Please don't call me anymore.
In this way, he was able to evade justice for many months adding to the unimaginable grief suffered by Rhys's mother and father,
The jury's heads will pop, and we will go away with nothing.
Where is she?
Looked like he drove out there by himself.
I still have this fantasy... that I'll meet somebody... who will love me, even though... they'll find out who I really am.
You scared the hell out of me. Come here.
And I don't want any more stealing, or bullying.
Louis is Frank Burns.
Even the hall cupboard.
Then convince them, alex.
And I'm not so good without my routines.
Some early morning yoga, huh?
- Yes, sir. - Wrong.
That's a fact.
The cemetery caretaker was Mr. William Storey, and... Father Maskell suddenly told him to get a front loader and dig a hole ten-by-20 feet in the back abandoned part of the cemetery.
One of our new part-timers is a huge fan.
Oh, poo! Well, do come join the fun when you're done.
Whoa, look at this!
I'm going to pull you out by the root and drag you down into hell with me.
Amado, as his second in command, has the necessary power to be recognized as their leader, but not enough that we can't control him.
- You made good time. - Yeah.
You wanted to know when Cora Tannetti had any visitors?
From now on, as his biggest fan I'll keep supporting him from afar.
This son of a bitch thinks he's a badass.
Do you want to hear it?
What happened here is that we have an incredible change in the Earth's system, basically kills the dinosaur everywhere on Earth - in Africa, Antarctica, in the forests, or in the savanna.
Okay, good. But that thing is attacking us.
Talk to him.
He's the Deputy Governor!
Ahh! Ahh... you fucking bitch!
Christopher, all clear?
So, where are you off to next?
- More cops are coming.
I'm, um, I'm just...
EPISODE 7 AFFECTION
Sam, please don't go. I...
I move to have the confession thrown out.
I thought she might... Wanted to reopen the question of whether or not we should leave and get married.
Because a lot of them have undertaken sex reassignment surgery and consider themselves on a higher rank than those who haven't.
How's that music program for inner city kids going?
How do you know that?
Which is why I needed to channel your magic to weaponize these crystals.
She is going to tear those women to shreds, piece by piece, and I feel sick about it.
Now do you understand what it is that you've come to speak to me about today?
I'm not here for a drink. I'm here to pick up a credit card.
All right, all right, you got my attention.
I had to protect the rest of the organization.
And I get it; she's super-annoying.
I'm sorry if I wasn't entirely myself.
Hey. What's wrong?
How about it?
I'm-I'm not willing to risk you getting sick, too...
Isn't it true that you have lied under oath and deceived this court for your own personal gain?
We don't think they're trying to poison the kids.
We even tried gold, like in the Webb telescope.
If you don't marry her, I will.
Well, this is the goddamn meeting.
And I live here, you know?
People like me been losing to people like him since the world first started spinning.
No, don't. Oh, s...
- OK, why?
Hey, I've been trying to call Fessler and I can't get through to her.
Look, my best guess...
Getting that cruise line on the cheap was better than sex with your mistress. Either of them.
Circa court 1997.
I saw the damage.
It's an old house.
And by the way, I don't work for you.
Two men from the south. Two from the north.
I'm just saying, he's got to know the place is wired.
Let's forget the toy thing, okay?
Who is he?
And now, it's time to announce the county show winner.
Toxicology report came back yesterday.
Are you fuckin' serious, Franky?
I already asked for the machine to be turned off, so that one does not count.
I'm really tired of this shit.
It's the truth.
All those in favor?
This is last night at The Oriana.
Jewelry, corsets, and the like.
ICU room 4.
- I'm not kidding. God.
She based it on Kennedy Malloy.
Do you have the key?
Previously on Zoo...
Did you come alone or did you bring the force with you?
Ask Toño to show you the hotel, come on.
He only ever talked about his colleagues... residents from the hospital.
If those suspects were involved, I believe it's undoubtedly as a flunky gofer.
Come on, it's not worth throwing away your career.
You're the editor for Shin Michima, aren't you? Yes.
Monsters aren't real.
This is the first time in my career that a bullet has taken a life without being fired.
Holloway Riding School always beats us.

Only the cute ones.
So to my galaxy of women.
And it will.
Till that happens, we just keep eyes on them.
We're entitled to the truth.
- Kiss me!
Beyond those hills is the old barn.
Hinkley, follow me!
They might not ever let us into a meeting again.
Yeah, I do.
That's my favorite hormone.
Y'all carry him.
You don't have to hang with me.
I saw him as both a colleague and later on, actually, as a friend.
- Hi. - Hey. Hey, we dodged a bullet with that GSW earlier...
What better way for her to strike back than to inflict the same fate on the guilty?
- Road to Foyers Point, where we were supposed to meet Jonjo.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
I don't know.
Yeah, that's not good.
MISSING, MIN-WOO CHOI
- You're judging me and I can... - What?
I won't do anything until you take me to my mom.
Wish me luck.
Because they were flying a pirate flag.
- Yeah, you are. Open up.
And I'm guessing your behavior right now is about something I said in an e-mail.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We need to stick together.
- As long as I don't tell you, you're not party to it.
He was there for all the bad times as well.
'It hurt... '..because I didn't want to do it.
That seems random.
No one approaches these men without backup.
Explains why it's about to blow.
He's a private jet broker, so...
He says, "I'm the Doctor", and they say, "Doctor who?"
It's undermined everything I'm trying to do?
Unless we make a deal.
No more special treatment for you, buddy.
The delivery driver.
All right, let me know the second you hear anything.
Ooh, you must have done somethin' pretty bad to deserve that.
This is the new direction I've been looking for.
Mmm, and what he said was even worse.
But I'm almost out of bullets.
Then, would you please tell us everything you know about Nanaka Hiraki?
Well, your uncle must've done it and my uncle didn't." Not at all.
After Colombia, Chapo had to be stopped.
- The canteen is now open for H Block.
- He's gonna help me.
The time he ended up in hospital.
But you could be a real knockout with a little help...
How you kids doing?
Neither Mr. Stone nor his co-council have the necessary security clearance to watch this video, much less possess it.
I mean, her ties to Reid are distant.
I write them, but I don't always finish them.
It's very possible that in referring to someone, Brother Bob, that could have been anybody.
And when he found out--
You underestimate Ms. Vargas.
Why did you stop?
After that turd rolled out of my pant leg... I ran into the woods and never stopped running.
He had Zehnder.
What do you want me to do?
That's the only place you could've gotten that shot glass.
I heard you might've fainted at work.
Keep watching him for the next few hours.
It-It's watch you commit suicide, but I'm trying to put that off as much as possible, you know what I mean?
See you later, sluts.
She asked, and I said no.
So hard, it makes the windows rattle.
Come on. It's hardly your career.
What's critical in these cases is the repetition of the criticism... the insult or blame.
You have it in for Natalie?
Here, why don't you let me hold her?
Last time I saw you, there were two dead guys in my cell.
It's different than all the rest that have come until now.
You must be tired.
You knew he was in a band? Sure.
That's close enough for the state to charge you as an adult.
No, no, no. $200.
I haven't had a chance to speak to her yet.
You and I are both in this photograph. Right. (LAUGHS) OK.
That's your event.
Let's just focus now on making you Governor.
It is a party that I am not going to miss no matter what.
- All right, stay there.
Nobody ever listens to me. If you want to die today, that's what you want to do, I'm fine with it.
Is it possible you were fooled by the Antichrist?
And obviously, something worth killing over.
Looks like he's still here.
It never was.
I had found a place not far from Contrada Tosacane.
'cause she just isn't super expressive? Yeah.
She got angry at the world. I tried to help her, like she helped me, but I couldn't, so I left.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I mean, what... what kinds of things would they say about themselves?
There you go.
Oh, I don't think Dwayne is putting pressure on anyone, he just wants to know what evidence you found in the church, no matter who that might point to.
We've lost control of space.
Who do you want me to be?

W... I thought I made it quite clear I'm not interested in your resignation.
Which is where your boyfriend comes in.
Judging by the stab wounds in the lower abdomen, severe blood loss, I'd say cause of death was multiple organ failure.
Perfect place for an ambush.
If Matron ever finds out I've done this...
Dear God, the Englishmen.
I can get better treatment for you back at court.
It's full of restaurants and terraces.
A little too quiet without you guys.
Just stand back.
No, no, we didn't push her.
That's what I'm doing.
Fuck off, old man.
Your dad's just being stupid.
Mr. Bojangles has asked you for his daily intel briefing.
I am so... tired of thinking about him.
They pay me one million yen a month in rent.
That sounds, I don't know, kind of fun.

And that was the turning point for me.
I don't respond to fishing expeditions from arts reporters.
And he ended up with esophageal cancer.
- Come on. - You know what, go. - What?
He stood up to them.
And worst of all?
I have read all your books, Michi.
Cut the crap.
- They're not relevant any more.
Do you have any advice?
Not just musicals.
- It was total bullshit.
It wasn't all your fault.
John Joseph Patterson, Kieran Whitehead, Evelyn Redford?
Only every other day.
The other one's an English Spangler and the other one is a dachshund.
- Have they found Dessie?
Masha, I can show you the truth.
Throw us off our game, confuse us.
And once we restore normal blood flow to your arm, we reconnect your hand.
Oh, my God.
Your first date?
My mom told me. It's not safe.
Why are you going to Guatemala?
I'm really sorry, 'cause I care about you.
I was kidding.
I'm going to fucking cut you.
Well, there's no holding him off.
My... Are you pretending to be Raina?
Well, guess what, sweetheart.
You know? - That does sound nice.
"and then take it out before it has a chance to take you out."
Like it had been erased?
And you didn't mind him asking you questions like that?
Solotov is dead.
You know I feel funny when I can't get online.
Andrew was my husband's best friend.
Now he does.
Reddington's supposed deal with the FBI is a matter of national security.
Sorry for the interruption.
Right, this is quality control, all right?
The helicopter should be leaving soon.

Sebastian was running some of the blood samples we got off of your knuckles.

Well... but, hey, that's what the bee said.

Harriet called in sick at the last minute.

It must have taken forever to reassemble.
What? Because I didn't go to MIT, I don't belong here?
Let's just say, I've laid the groundwork.
We got this. I will call you the minute we have a lead.
- Vincent, please.
That's actually not a thing.
He's a lazy motherfucker.
I'm 26, and maybe it was a different story when I was 16, but right now, I am all about long-term commitment.
You're gonna be okay, Kathy.
The prodigal daughter returns.
You can't succeed with traitors in your midst.
By the time I realised the mistake, it was too late.
Which could dilute the MelvatoxB, you're right.
Did your wife take you back?
Tanya, you need to stop lying to me.
Mama, is everything all right?
I'll leave y'all to rot down there, and no amount of prettyfaced guilt is gonna save your ass, you hear me?
Definitely not pink or perfect.
But I certainly don't have that type of coin laying around.
Should be done soon.
Uh, last time you managed to persuade him to overturn the board's decision, but you can't have it both ways.
What are you doing?
It will only be able to stay on the ground three minutes.
Left pupil's blown.
So you want a statue because you jumped from the kid's table to the table with men?
How did we get out of the cave? You bumped your head.
Oh, I don't know, mate.
You know where to reach me.
I should've never come to the hospital.
Well, unfortunately, our room looks like you hosted - a bum fight in it.
I was fortunate.
Hey, I don't, um... I don't think I've seen you here before.
Finally, we have hard evidence of just how powerful the asteroid strike really was.
What do you mean?
They're indebted to me because I make them a lot of money.
Or maybe you're smart enough to wait until he has no protection at all.
But he let his ego get the best of him, and it's not about the cause anymore.
Ah! - Ready?
He wasn't. This...
Thank you, my love.
You may have saved your friends, but you won't stop me from returning to my home.
Been using it a lot lately with the newer recruits.
Better get ready for the dance, Coop.
I take it back, I take it back!
It was wonderful, though you may wanna tell the cleaning staff there's a lot of dust in the light fixtures up there.
Here you go, you two.
Is this coming from the secretary?
My name is Dr Andrew Patterson.

Maybe this time you listen more than you speak.
Dad, I know you've only been awake a couple of days, but... I just wanted to tell you that I love you.
WATER IN THE ASHTRAY BY SHIN MICHIMA
But these clues to what it was linger on in a place like this attic.
Which is more than me and Renee paid for our first house.
- My guess is, they are using the mother box to circumvent the safeguards on the amethyst, so they can open up a gateway to Gemworld.
Please, please call me back.
I'm hoping it'll get me a practice girlfriend.
Yeah, I was. Don't be so modest, Bob.
Unfortunately, some of them were killed because they were trying to help us catch Reddington.
Well... I saw her scurrying out in a flap, like an alarmed goose and, when I went to investigate her concern, I found a dead man in my car.
Preparetobe boarded. (CHOPPER GRUNTING)
What made me uncomfortable was that... waiter telling' me I made a good choice, like I needed his approval.
Where'd you go?
- Just let me talk to him for a second.
I'll save you the trouble.
I don't blame her.
I know people are confused by me, or-or curious, and that's fine.
He's got the detonator!
Isaac, why don't you tell us a little about what happened inside that place?
Clearly, we need to step up our security measures.
Fill her up.
It T-bones into a loading dock about a mile and half up.
May God bless you and keep you safe.
And just to piggyback off of that, thank you, Susie.
Is she gonna die?
They'll revert to their wild wolf nature.
- Yeah. I appreciate that.
Is it? Yeah. Stop acting like a lunatic.
"Your petticoat is showing", you know? "Your desire is showing."
See that, Anna?
You don't get to just parachute in here and carry on like nothing happened.
Keep me in the loop.
I need you to act like everything is okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think he got it.
Turns out she ran off with another guy.
Let's get a head tilt.
This news of a serial killer, do you think it'll affect trade?
I won't tell anyone.
I know that's still a thing.
"That boy is mine.
No, no, no.
When this great evil arrives, how many more will be hurt?
I was just curious 'cause he seemed to be so involved with the police all the time.
Get ahold of yourself.
What's the deal?
Get this guy's photo to all air and sea ports. Make sure he doesn't leave the island.
Oh, we'll see about that.
Do you need something?
It was... These were really very... special days.
- The junior counselors from 1981.
Weller and Remi took her to a black site.
I'm going to get a coffee.
- We'll find a way.
I don't know, it looks pretty human.
The ten years that I was in the Army, I just sort of dug my head in the sand and was just...
And if I did, I'd already be back in Russia.
Look, it's not too late.
We do need to speak to Tendu.
Hey, Lou, any chance you can get into that office, take a look around?
Yeah, don't smother her.
Well, then, we'd have to wonder why.
Uh, it's... it's just Liz.
- is a Goddamn joke. - Louis, you need to calm down right now before this goes in the wrong direction, 'cause this isn't about Stephanie.
I'm a media consultant with a very deep client list.
Here, lean on me.
- What? - She caught me by surprise.
- and then she came in here to kill me.
- Three times.
What a gentleman.
I am not trying to be nosy.
Okay, let's go.
- Here we go.
And a deal with Russia on... tax avoidance.
No, my "Pino" is not shy.
I landed us an invite to the zombie truthers meeting tomorrow night.
I bet he choked on his own spit, begging you to stay.
I think you're afraid.
- We had a deal.
And that song...
If you're looking for spare change, I already cleaned it out.
I like it, Zehnder.
I can't stay.
For this kind of thing, I should probably go and thank her, right?
She took out as many FBI agents as she could during that compound raid.
What's going on, Ma?
You cannot harm...
Things are spinning out of control.
We should get started, then.
But what he didn't know, what he never could learn... was when to turn down a drink.
God bless Mama.
What the hell are we doing, standing around in this warehouse?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
Don't you know it's dangerous down here?
"He's got, like, a side parting in his hair.
Specifically in the girlfriends and women that were objects of my desire, breasts were not exactly special items to me.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm gonna stink until I'm 16.
He's... starting to get into trouble.
We won, Seth.
You're excited about this opportunity, right?
You and your partner.
You didn't notice your new best friends are off your ass and you didn't have to exchange sexual favors to do it.
You think he knew her?
So slap on that cologne and take a hit of that breath spray, â€˜cause it's time to do some night howling.
That's why we came here.
He can, but it's still not changing my mind.
We should just keep walking around.
Hey, I think I found something!
Let's take this to the secretary.
Uh, Mr. Reddington, whatever this is... - I-I don't wanna know.
All six of those planes are on their way to landing safely.
Look at that.
I want to know everything Sang-man did since he came in!
But that's over now.
I've been promoted to senior VP!
Preparing to launch.
Which I know is an annoying thing to have to think about when you're dating an 18-year-old dude, but that's what you get with Sam.
My husband attacked me after you left.
So, locals are interrogating a baggage handler out of Taoyuan Airport in Taiwan.
Okay, well, I get that.
I'm here to talk to you, detective to detective.
Where has Father Brown got to?
Do yourself a favor... learn something from Jay, like how to be tough.
Yet we still haven't heard a number.
The release from a feeling of entrapment.
- You expect me to believe that you own all the guards in here, but you didn't know about a conspiracy at your last prison?
We have suffered reef damage, taking on water. I repeat: we are taking on water.
Are you listening to this?
I just thought I'd let you know, as a professional courtesy.
Is it my condition, my age?
The peace of mind that comes with knowing you'll leave Firewood with your legacy intact.
It just beamed when she smiled. She beamed.
My boy, you did it.
Yeah. - Told you.
Brrm, brrm, mate! Fuck. Things are worse than I thought.
I want NYOOPI to help its members be better at what they do.
Okay, right now, sunshine, tons of people, he's safe.
You could finish me, be the hero.
I don't know. I'm a genius. I am new to this feeling stuff.
I'll walk you home.
I'm not gonna send my men into a de facto war zone.
Um... [in Spanish] And [in English] by the way...
Forget about it.
If it dies, it dies.
Look what he did to me.
You'll pray for her?
Ms. Barrows, can you comment on the recent murder of DOD employee Walter Carnahan at his home?
And IAB was called.
But this priest, Father Joseph Maskell, there was something about him.
I know I was supposed to give Sam his lunch money, but I can't find him.
We put her behind the shop."
How's he doing?
For this selection committee, I'd like to include a special guest.
Harvey, listen to yourself.
It smells awful.
Keep playing, man!
And with the dance only 510 minutes away, decorations must be made.
The killer dead by her own hand.
Holly, I want you to go to the police.
You freed him of sin.
They're not gonna care. Come on.
- Yeah. - What are you doing here?
Answer your phone!
Got to work.
- A lockdown is now in force.
So, if we can just get them to just drive it out there to the satellite.
To the right lies the ordinary world with its pleasures and pains.
I've been trying to figure it out for years.
I can't see anything.
Oh, no, God damn it.
We were going through microfilm, going back through all the papers to figure out what happened.
You can offer me a goddamn polar bear if you never plan on giving it to me.
Now I can't even get up... and change the damn channel.
I'm a very good dentist. Top of my class.
Have Dawson and Nagel dig in.
It's probably just my mom.
All right, we're in.
- Pardon me?
I'm just saying, I thought we agreed on a few boxes. Not a truck full of junk.
How do we stop this guy?
- And how many pairs were made?
Why would you do that?
If he reaches out, maybe there's still a way we can negotiate.
And when I saw Maskell's face next to him... all I thought was, "Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh shit."
I prefer to be non-violent normally, but I should tell you I have been trained in Krav Maga.
- From first shift.
All right, so where would the Molly's logo go?
I think he just wanted to put her mind at ease.
I MUST LOOK AFTER THE WOMEN
Well... thank you for sharing that insight, it's been most valuable...
I'm still trying to establish communication and waiting on drones, stand by.
There was a crime but it wasn't yours.
I just don't want...
He died during a gunfight at the international airport of Guadalajara.
Because, you know, he doesn't even know what a "perp" is.
- No. Anyway*...
She wanted a second opinion.
One time, it was this person, and he referred to him as a Brother Bob.
Where are you?
I owe you.
You put your life on the line.
What are we talking about?
First of all, it's school policy.
Check the bedrooms.
I'm sorry, sir, she's still out there.
Let's get you on the phone first.
He wasn't always like this.
Because if I break both your ankles, you'll be tied up in a hut in the middle of nowhere with no food, no water, no vehicle.
Hey. Our date's tomorrow, isn't it?
I found this.
Yeah, the job should be relatively quick, and we can't just let the fire burn.
What is it, Raymond?
Stop it, please.
Well, here we are, eh? !
- Well, I don't give a shit what they said.
Do not tell your mother I said that.
Mum, where the hell have you been?
We're not done looking.
No, just need to pick up a few things.
Did not cook.
It won't even be her that pulls the trigger.
Don't be smug with me.
- Come on.
It was nice seeing you two.
You wanted to be a boss so bad, and now you won't enjoy it?
Being prepared for something doesn't necessarily speak to desire, and here we are.
Raven is still on the island. It was Sam.
Beg for your life.
I'll see you guys when I see you.
Got a woman watching my every move.
- He's not answering his phone... his phone... his phone...
They shut it down.
His, uh, family's on the way in now.
After graduation, I went to med school, and Anna went into nursing.
I have Minister Chen for you on SVTC.
Like they care.
You just throw your heart around like it's nothing.
Lives in Shreveport, drove down yesterday to prep.
I just don't understand why you didn't say, "I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't help you."
I go to prison and Sean's laughing his head off.
- We think Krilov somehow programmed Ressler to believe Hitchin abducted a witness that could connect her to Reven Wright's murder.
But we don't have much time.
I don't think they bought that.
Where is he?
I'm still waiting on that quote from Anna, so I wasn't able to finish the O'Neil list.
I don't need you here just to keep Duke away from me.
Yeah, yeah. Good try, good try.
No reason. We just wanna keep the exclusive on this thing.
I'd come home and he'd have every light in the flat on.
That's all the muscle you could muster?
"And every night about midnight."
And he wasn't just any camper.
It wasn't an Iranian nuclear scientist referencing how much enriched uranium they were using.
I gotta give him money, I give my mom money, my little brother get money.
Bumblebee, you've got to stop.
Ooh, I know that tone, Dwayne.
Your vlog is great.
You've never sampled a maiden?
And how many of those mother box things do you guys carry around with you anyway?
Al, you still got it.
Purse, pen, diary, laptop cable.
- There's something I need to talk... wetnursing a community in meltdown.
- Go underneath it.
Dr. Kean, airway.
They were following you?
What is it, nap time already? Get your asses in gear.
I'll give you one. Instead of you asking me for a handout, you should watch your backside, because you've got a missile coming straight for you.
I've had a lot of time to think about what I did.
Thomas is in prison.
Because if you accept her memories as valid, and, initially, I was unsure, but I'm beginning to come around to thinking that they are.
Well, as an agent of the U.S. government, you would know that the law requires a ten-day waiting period before the sale of a firearm.
Well, most of them are.
I could also just become a blacksmith and use primitive tools for an obsolete job in a world that no longer exists.
I colluded with Sonia Stevens?
- I'm the motherfucking world champion.
He saved our lives.
In our society, they go for the deep pockets.
I'm not religious. My sister is. And you can't possibly be that ignorant.
If you want any more stroking, I'll have to charge.
With that in mind...
- What the hell do you think letting Katrina Bennett and Company walk over to you without a fight was?
Kid's pissed at you? For a brilliant child, he is unreasonable.
Hold him! Hold him!
Oh, it's Chuck.
Maybe they'll go from two tomato can level to one tomato can level to, you know, half journeyman level.
Hands on your head.
Yeah. And you had been in so many different places on so many different nights with so many different men, that you simply made a mistake, did you not?
Really? You're married?
What is the matter with you?
Oh, darling, you were.
You tortured Jodie Spiteri.
What are you talking about?
Child abuse charges going back to the 1980s.
She was so full of compassion for everyone and everybody.
There's just you doing what it takes to stay on the inside and stop whatever their real endgame is.
I think this time we'll talk in our office.
Everything okay with you and Louis? - Yeah.
I hope you understand.
You wanted to talk.
I was scared you'd changed your mind and that what Matron said made you go.
We were wondering where you were.
So you can be with your Queen Bea.
I take it this isn't a cross-cultural exchange program.
GENERAL BLANCO, THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT HAND AND UNPUNISHED CRIMINAL
She took it, instead of going to court.
I know that she was telling the truth about the Protectors before.
You're so sweet, Michi.
I just immediately was drawn to him.
Don't patronize me.
- I don't know about this, Kaz.
Then I found Macy Stonem's panties under his bed.
Our careers went off in different directions.
It's driving me out of my fucking mind.
I don't think we should push her.
I'm Agent Loya.
What I don't understand is why you're doing it at Maria's expense.
I don't know anything about those old people who got killed, though.
Here's the rest of your stuff.
He didn't trust Morrison, so he kept the weapon.
I had fun with you today. Me, too.
to give us the latest details from this afternoon.
So here's what we're gonna do, Mark.
There's someone in.
She first reacts with humor.
What are you doing, Mr. President?
Need a hand?
- Yeah, Donna, we're on good terms.
To be honest, I'm relieved.
I mean, the physical side was so there.
We need a minute. Yeah.
No... We need to go.
I'm sorry I'll never get to see our kid get his or her GED.
Ready for your big day, Lonnie?
And the way they schedule the nurses, sometimes we go a whole week without seeing each other.
The Prosecutor rang me, they left a message and I... didn't check my voice-mail.
Well, I appreciate it, Tandy, but I think I just need to walk around a little bit.
Thank you for giving me back my life.
Well... to tell you.
I don't know much about the literary world, but maybe if it got a lucky break, it would sell.
Not in this case, no. And I suppose that's not why you're tracking his accounts.
There's another on our wing to the south.
They're twins attached by the skin.
As a matter of fact, I would.
Pete, don't do this!
No, it's more than that.
It's Patrick's girlfriend's birthday.
Liz, Liz, Liz.
Lose my phone number.
- No, no, no.
Great job, guys.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-There you go.
I wouldn't. I wouldn't say something like that.
You don't need to be angry to fight.
Yeah, I already tried that, they're all clean.
We don't want droopy lighting.
Hey, Care Bear.
- Well, where is it?
Thank you for that, Angela.
I'll have chicken.

Wait, it's stuck.
Actually, Trevor, Blake is the executive assistant to the secretary of state.
The palace, it's coming down.
She always gets scared when Daddy's not here.
I don't know, you're looking a little shaky there, pal.
That's the spirit.
Oh, this is not good.
Our policy is very clear.
Is that really what you'd call that merry band of degenerates, jobe?
Mia, we're going to have to wait out the storm.
- Or Matron's reprimanding.
I feel sorry for David, but there's nothing we can do to help him.
You know what?
Do you have any idea where he might be, how we can reach him?
They were liars and thieves.
We're here to talk about a murder.
Because that was in front of my whole family.
Take me to Queensland instead.
Yeah, you and Special Agent McGee were sent to New Orleans to recover stolen Intel, yes? Yes.
It was a stolen car from British Imports in Towson.
Are you accusing me, Vera?
Paid the last transfer...
Can it tell us where Darius was the exact moment the probe was hacked?
- It's temporary.
Will you do me a favor and just give me a shout when the service team gets here?
- Oh, Jake.
Call the police.
Your concern is that they're playing us to undermine our negotiations on other key issues.
I wanted her here to bear witness.
But just in case, I've oiled his hooves, shampooed his mane...
I can help you.
Step in and I'll show you.
Just give it to me, you fucking prick! - Come on, give it to me! - Get off me!
We'll be able to show the D.A. that we knew where to go thanks to this little gem.
So, we won't get medals until we get funding.
- It's about her own experiences.
Then my life was written in detail, where I was born, where I went to school, the part-time jobs I had, my relationships and friends at the time, that I published my debut novel at age 26, that my novels were unsuccessful, details about my family, that my father was on death row.
Are you Doreen?
Mr. Ross, my son was 28 years old.
Then, about an hour ago, I get a package.
Can I come in?
Okay. Yeah. Um...
- Sandra's disgusted with you.
It's nice to meet you.
I'm asking myself the very same question.
Had to shut down oil production till we welded them up.
Hey, Chalmers, Kolvair, you got my O2 tanks?
Rufus, remember, you're not dead yet, so...
Can't you see that I'm trying to do you a favor?
Imagine what everyone would say.
Tough spot's pretty much the job description, Sid.
We live in a future so great, we don't have to do anything.
It could be an infection.
Just get the bastard who killed our dad.
Well, I'm not.
"thank you for collectively losing your minds."
Both of you.
We all want the same thing.
I don't want the deal anymore.
So who are you?
Oh, my god!
I read his novel, Drifting ... Drifting ...
Oh, crap. That Nelly Gutierrez from Clayton Prep is running today.
He did an amazing job.

You'll do exactly as I please.
Our suspect sponsored dozens of work visas for Mexican nationals.

He said he was making progress, moving up in the gang.
You wanna talk about it?
- I'm not evil! - You are not evil!

Yeah. She's alerting the State's Attorney as we speak so that she can witness the written statement signed.
Rosin. His name's Scott.
She told me everything.
I felt that the Church was saying that I should never have opened my damn mouth, that I was supposed to keep the secret, that I was supposed to stay silent.

She died in a fire.
Matched at Chicago Med!
As I was saying,
Did you see what happened?

Oh, well. I'll get it right in the end.
Is this about your office again?
You know, the phrase "serial killer"
May I help you?
What's Kensi and Deeks' location?
- yet another assumption?
That's why you won't have anything to say, period.
You walked me into a friggin' ambush!
Did Steven know you were taking payouts?
Well, yeah, you know, that's just sort of bound to happen.
You won't see me for several days.
What if I'm the one who can't see?
See what the brother has to say.
How long's it been?

Is this your handwriting?
The hair found in the van driven by this man matches the heart found on the beach.
I thought it was a subway delay.
Nothing. I don't understand why you do all that working out if you're not gonna flaunt your cute figure.
- Cape. It's a hell of a cape. But, uh...
I don't know.
I'm gonna be perfectly clear about this.
I don't have to.
- Now get back to work.
- My dad booked it.
Do you really think that he can handle it?
I am Mazzacolla, as you will know the superintendent has entrusted me... a part of the research of Barletta.
Thank you so much.
Must get pretty drafty up there on your high horse.
Not with Blakeslee sharpening his knives.
That means you're writing to increase your own worth?
The money trail's gone dry, the North Sudanese government's not cooperating.
And then I woke up on the kitchen table at home.
Air pressures are coming down. Sats are coming up.
They're here, sir.
If Kimmy was here right now, she would tell you to beg Kimmy to come back. Oh, yeah?

And I have, finetuned this device to detect the heartbeat of a snake that size when it's within range.
I did do it!
My friend Patty swears that it's a great way to meet guys.
No. I'm gonna help her.
As far as I'm concerned, any innuendo that you're involved in criminal activity, much less a drug cartel, is not only absurd, it's libel-worthy.
- So nice of you to come, Kate.
At last, General Dodonna's fleet has arrived.
Lieutenant Casey would like to have a word.

We've got to try and stop him.
Oh, wow, that's...
Don't you value human life?
On his own?
I've been having lessons.
Really, it's about just listening, saying, "I'll be there, and we'll find the help together."
Okay, let's try it again, this time with a little more feeling.
That boy in the backseat... is there anything I should know?
Pretty sure Pride just got an ass-chewing from HQ.
What were you doing?
- You've been in bed all day.
- What? Do you remember when we went to Africa?
-You're definitely drunk.
He's doing parabiosis.
There's a target the size of Louisiana on you right now.
Is that so?
'It was never a good house.'
Huh? Would you have let anybody stop you if they tried?
Well, I guess we're going to Yonkers.
How can you be so smart and so clueless?
This is LAPD Detective Marty Deeks.
Maybe we can find some clues in Kyle's room.
Bye, Carol. Okay, I'm supposed to check her hearing and reflexes, when you have a chance.
The dirty socks, jocks.
This was the closest we've ever seen it, with just one point in it.
We could figure out who took...
- Big bull's piss-scared of dentists.
You caught the Veah Hayes murder case, right?
Um, Muriel's, our beautiful angel of mercy.
- Isn't that the guy you killed?
- I don't know.
It's gonna open up a can of worms.
We haven't had sex in so long.
I see some similarities between the two of you.
Get ready, we're going out.
I only know how to follow the recipe.
It's against the rules to ask those kinds of questions.
Yeah, I hope it went well, but we're kind of in the middle of something.
Or have you loaded yourself with silver, crosses, and garlic in superstitious fear?
Did you put something on it?
- If I'm not mistaken, you don't seem to be your usual self.
- I'm starting to realize that.
Well, thank you.
But I got it.
All of the sudden, Kennedy was there, standing with a gun pointed at my face.
But I'm sure you already knew that. You're the expert on all things Syria.
- I did?
- Okay, let's go.
Something that big, I don't know.
He talks to Dessie about being bullied.
I don't know.
We're inside your dream.
But one that's tailored to us.
Is this some kind of undercover operation?
Who do you think called off the delivery?
Are you okay?
Anyone seen Dessie Toner?
You got the wrong guy!
-the only way to know for sure... -Is for me to go back to Los Pinos.
They're all gone.
He's got momentum right now.
I know I haven't said it in along time, and I need to.
Or wouldn't it be fun for him... to try and find us?
I took a life, Sam.
- I fuckin' missed you.
Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler's elbow?
You... You are engaged!
My time in the Triangle...
Reagan spent billions researching it.
I got a thumbs-up.
The kind you get after a rainfall.
! What do we do? !
How does evidence go missing, Ms. Reagan?
Your deal was falling apart.
He never gave up.
What do you mean?
Actually... reminds me of home.
So stop fuckin' lying and tell me what you knew about him.
You only have three minutes.
How'd you know it was a money stash?
I don't have time to babysit that emotionally stunted genius.
- How was the exhibit?
- Mom! Mom! Yeah?
Because now that it is at the Plaza,
So long as he told us the truth.
I have noticed.
We're gonna need a bigger car soon anyway.
Look at that.
So, anyway, Coach called me into his office today
Don't pretend you give a shit, Franky.
Well, at least check if Morrison's in New Zealand.
Her life was worth 100 million yen.
That's quite the workout.
I can't believe we're really gonna meet Mr. Willy Wonka.
Ah, the prettiest lady here.
So, how you gonna do that?
H5 has a spare cell.
- Is this real?
Because we both know you can't have Pfizer.
I can't ride him until I figure out what his problem is.
- He didn't shoot Santos.
It's a new plan.
By the way.
So, Michelle's body was recovered by LAPD.
And she came to our launch. And, of course, it meant we were in every newspaper, on the news.
With a handgun like that this is the sort of exit wound I would expect to see as the bullet squeezed out through the skin.
Like a cigarette.
Or maybe he's just making me think that he's changed, you know?
So hurry up!
That's what I said.
- Who wanted to finish?
Just hang in there, OK.
I don't want that.
Be very quiet.
Stop it now!
He's never satisfied.
You don't know?
Get out - you're driving.
Vera told me.
Neither did I.
Where is she, anyway?
- Hey, Mandy.
If Jonjo Patterson isn't found, people are going to want to know why you didn't alert the community sooner.
Take it, you fucking cunt!
When I was little... I couldn't say "Peter."
I don't kiss for fun.
And when he wakes up, he'll smell it baking and know that everything's okay.
Great sister skills.
What does that mean?
So, your name's Aiko.
The shooting's all over the news.
But that looks nice.
I know Tina's got one stashed.
- Yes, what have you got for us?
Like you did at the firehouse?
It's nice to see you taking an interest in Amy's work.
- It's nothing you haven't proposed to Jessica before.
So, maybe our pilot's just late?
The life we deserve.
And I was thinking, it's just an ex. You know, she's just badmouthing him.
This is the deepest part of the web.
You and me.
It seems that you two still have a lot to talk about.
- As long as it's your choice.
- What was that?
Seconded, yeah. That may be a bit of a problem.
I'll switch you off on our end, but I'll check back in in 90 seconds.
BATGIRL: Okay, girls,
Well, Mr. Storey was pretty street smart, it sounded like.
What about our people?
Rest assured, your government will sweep this whole tawdry mess under a rug providing we continue to deliver the goods on my list.
When I saw that guy kissing our pregnant lady... i got this really sick feeling in my stomach.
It will take time to change the way you girls think in here, but I am determined to make that happen.
I just listened, more than anything.
I was kind of hoping we could start over, you know?
What do you think you're doing, coming to my door now?
Bring Patton back.
Your destination is at the end of the road.
What's she supposed to do with two left shoes?
Okay. All right. You know what, buddy?
The teacher brings him right out into the water.
- You've got yourself a deal.
There's nothing I can do for him.
Oh, seriously, stop.
Does not look seaworthy.
Should I go and get my sleeping bag?
Okay, this witch. Did she evacuate with the others?
I doubt any boat could've got through that storm.
I don't know.
- This attack comes after a long period - Come on. of a national soul-searching in the wake of the G20 crisis.
I look good, right?
Well, you know what?

Sometimes you got to let go and just trust it.
H-He's not confused about it or f... he's just focused and-and vital
- What the fu...?
Otherwise, why are we seeing each other?
Well, one of the things, anyway.

Complex systems analysis.
It was... fun.
This job might be a great fit for you, too, you know?
It's my name.
Minor speed bump.
You know my aunt in Australia?
Okay, deep breath.
Did you find that on the Internet?

And, to make sure that there's no paper trail, Turnleaf would send him checks for a book that he would never actually write.
Are you sure you know what you're doing, Joan?
There'll be something.
Who told you that?
Mike... he was infuriated.
You take my power.
Everybody was wondering who was Jane Doe.
That was Commander McGarrett.
Oh, yes, you most definitely will.
You're the best, Poppy.
How was I doing, what was going on, how did I like Keough?
You stole those car keys.
Thank you, Viv.
I had about a-a third of what I owed him.
Oh, that's right.
Her name is Abigail Westbrook and so far, tracking her down has been, uh...
Because you're my friend.
Jasmine, can you walk us through the evening, please?
I'm the only one who hurts people in these woods.
- Your registration approval.
Spain wants Henri on the throne and you do not have the power to save Charles.
This is the story in question, is it not?
We can't put a guy like that out on the street.
Maybe the two of you should take some time - to talk it over?
Pride's been pushed to the limit, Percy, all right?
Okay. Hope that was okay.
All right, well, then it's between us.
Do it right, okay?
And we now have multiple accounts that the shots that killed Martelli were fired at 11:00 a.m. in Bunny Fletcher's apartment.
So you have.

What can I do you for?
And, yeah, I do realize the irony of me telling you to drop the lone wolf crap.
Guy's as guilty as it gets.
What is real, what you can taste and touch and feel.
These are great.
You're out of line, Professor Bannon.
I need to see Ferguson.
That's just the way it works.
In view of the serious nature of this offence, because of the risk of further offences being committed and the likelihood of Mercer absconding, we ask that he be remanded in custody.

I can't open the hydraulics compartment; it's depressurized.
Hey, it's me!
If you did, you wouldn't be here.
He'll tell you that
Yes, that's true, but...
And it's those small steps, which I think can make a big difference.
What's he doing?
Because things are seeming a little biblical around here.
You know why I left the office, Erin.
Erase it. Who taught you that?
Why did he do this?
Stay with me, wife.
They're from his famous coffin of cobras escape of 1923.
It can go over the fireplace.
I'll grab the First Aid kit.
- You got this. Yeah!
I'll come back with some.
Okay. I'll take the roads.
The bad news is, we can't hack it remotely, so we'll have to use good, old-fashioned human intelligence instead.
My Fairy Godmother?
[Zyan] Juan! Juan...
- If you tell us, you'll be out on bail before your favorite ice cream store closes.
- Since I got here, I have had to take shit from Louis.
Not my arms. Please, not my arms.
She could not really take care of Melody -
It'll get nicked on the bus.
There is some bleeding.
And that is protected... by an anti-tamper device.
That's from the Khatyrka meteor that fell in Siberia in 2011.
You deserve it.

What are you doing on the outside?
What? That can't be true.

You gotta get outta here.
And that's all that matters.
Well, that would've been a real problem for the D.A.
I want to help you.
Get me what I need.
Who are you?

We volunteered to help villagers set up a girls' school in Khartoum, but then Boko Haram attacked.

Don't shoot him.
I even used the stuffing from Paige's murdered penguin as a snow base.
He made me executor of his will.

Genius, truly. So what is left that I wouldn't want to admit?
Can you listen to what she's saying then tell me what she's talking about?
Or was it your mistake in the first place?
So we thought we'd better get one, too, in case he modifies his to affect the encryption.
- He is perfect.
He deliberately took on your case because he's the culprit!
Okay, Rajan, I don't under...
I don't believe it.
Go on, show her who's the boss.
Roarke is going to be president, and your legacy is one of hiding inconvenient truths.
I'm not the reason the operation went sour.
Go ahead, it's fine.

Oh, after what you did yesterday?
I need to know exactly...

Is that why you brought him home?
Now, is it definite or not?
She rode with you, and now she's dead.
No. We have an agreement.
Erin... you need to move on.
Maybe if I don't look at it, it'll go away.
I'm showing them the real Major, the one who is sweet, and smart, and funny, and charming.
Follow the money.
What do you think?
Okay, okay, it's not that you're going, it's that you

Long hug. Okay.
He probably could've.
Then you're on your own.
Gibbs, is your team working on a case?
all my buddies who died over there, they kept visiting me in my sleep.
We weren't solely business partners.
- So how're you doing, Harvey?
And they're live-streaming it, so like 60,000 people are watching.
Repeat that, Squad 6.
-How do I know I can trust him?
- Just shut up!
Has that come up at all?
Oh, photographs? Yeah.
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

He's got lung cancer, not brain cancer.
I was talking about your mental stability. It has nothing to do with your achievements. - I mean, I'm very proud of you.
Do everything I tell you.
Annie, don't close your eyes.
All I need you to do is make one phone call.
What an odd goal to aspire to.
Okay, I get it, I get it.
I'm going to take a bath now.
- You glad you've got the night off?
You think it's related?
He wasn't even on this coast!

They'll find a way to stop you.
How much is in there?
You only have one hand.
SBK, they're not your friends, Laquan.
He's in unstable V-tach.
Not just for Scotland.
I wouldn't have been so blase about it and everything else. But, erm, that phone call sticks in my mind quite, quite heavily.
Where is he?
I mean, certainly not castration.
How large is it?
- I didn't think you had it in you.
That's funny, given what we found in your bag.
When do you want to meet Herrerías?
The area is completely surrounded.

Rick, what have you got?
- Copy that, 5021.
Well, I'm gonna keep pushing you.
- Don't say another word.
Or... on the other hand... perhaps I could offer you some free advice?
This is all your fault!
Have you decided?
Go in there, give it another go.
Beth, listen to Blake.
Hopefully the psychosis should resolve itself.
Mom and Dad left it to all of us.
Give me that.
We kept it that way so you wouldn't be involved.
Hey, little fella!
- Mm. It's an Olympic sport.
Oh, I found the problem. Wind speed's dropped from 21 to 11 miles per hour. That is too slow to create enough power to spin the winch.
I thought that was just a once-off.
We know that you did this.
No, I know people have legs.
I'll be right back.
Look, he's been shot before, but for real.

Sounds like you got squat.
Then we take care of it.
- Look at her. - Indeed.
You all right?
And then you calm down, but then you panic and you freak out.
You motherfuckers just bought this shit off a lot.
'Cause some of that was bad news.
So there's one lad gonna get the blame.
The way I see it, I helped you out pretty good on that situation you had last year.
Jesus is up in his room.
- If you get my meaning. - Always.

-How about it, Yuki?
I know where to find her.
Just send my books, please.
Where's Marino anyway?
And I think that we forget that sometimes.
There's nothing to worry about.
Listen, all we did was honestly judge his work.
I dare you to steal third, you...
He's turning, he's turning.
I need to borrow the mobile.

Bribes go a long way in this town.
Not until the Colonel vets the mom on the Intel.
My name is Tomas, and I'm going to take care of you.
Yeah. So as soon as we get the schedule, we pick the party with the highest rollers.
Hell no, we won't go!
Don't like to contradict Sam.
But Jaime Bray is our business.
These are the mafia bosses?
I didn't know what heathen meant.
I never knew you as a romantic, Gregorio.
And I didn't understand any of that.

Everyone in maternity out to the courtyard.
Then could we please grab a burger and talk about Resident Evil 7?
Squad 3 catch a lot of runs here?
Just to make certain that ISRO and NASA will mesh well.
All caps. CDW CS2, forward slash.
That shouldn't have happened.
You have to acknowledge what you did, process it for what it is-- a job that had to be done.
So, it is a very interesting dynamic to feel both of them in the room, to be cornered by them both, to feel two men of not only great size, but that they were powerful because they represented God.
- You got to fight through this.
Tell me a little bit more about your brother.
Where's my centrifuge?
It's trash day.
But that is not the case, and you can defend your actions.

This can come in here.
- All right.
I want to see you two.
I'm just a magician named John Knockando.
Like, uh, like moving an inmate into a particular cell? Something like that.
- Street map.
That's the reason why honorable men and true defenders of justice felt the need to take matters into their own hands in the hope that her maternal instincts will compel my mother to do the right thing.
So you want me to go behind his back.
Time to be bad.
Give me that quarter.
The list that you gave Gregory, the social worker who was around for a while, that was a list of lots of men, wasn't it?

There's a life out there!
A natural anesthetic.
Are you lost?
Am I off the case?
40 seconds! Knife?
I cannot live without you, my love.
Just like my dad.
Yeah, she's in her room, Capitol Police are guarding her.
What can I do?
You get to go out with all your friends and meet hot chicks, while I stay at home and watch tv?
We're escorting this hot new Superstar to the ring.
Pride's out there trying to get answers from Hamilton.
I was having a family reunion.

I don't want to speak for Leonard.
Got fresh tire tracks right here.

People are like, "What is he doing? That's ugly.
Paige will hold the tubing, and then I will start pumping the blood through the filter.
You've got to be kidding me.
He's unimpeachable. Truly.
don't you want to find out for yourself?
General, are you all right?
Oh, so good, new guy, who doesn't feel new because your deep baritone voice comforts me.
Well, if not him, then who?
- Did a sweep for bugs?
You don't get it.
Thanks, but I'm not gonna be able to make it.
You're that novelist Shin Michima, right?
I actually said that earlier.
I mean, your work is really important and I'm very happy to help, so...
It's just you and me, Mom.
I am not a cat, and I did not drag them in.
I made a little study for her down in the basement.
Nobody'll say anything against him because they're all too scared.
Quick to anger?
What are you talking about?
- So, you saw this?

Good for her.
I swear, he must've gone to the same law school as my sister:
Driving in, just heard someone from Rochdale Council Safeguarding Children on the radio
I'm sorry for busting up your party.
Better never late is more like it.
So, ask yourself... if you want to go against this government, or if it would be in your interest to be on our side.
You have no other homework for the weekend.
More importantly, you wrote this, the rest of the letter the victim was holding.
With a fishy smell and a crab stuck in my cd changer.
Right, that's one very grubby daughter in the bath.

Whatever it is, if it's not about locating Reddington--
Why are you asking me that?
- Find someplace else to sit.
Because I'm no longer in ac ondition to fulfill my duties as a Minister.
It isn't about whether the guys that did it are Pakistani. It's what the hell was a 13-year-old girl doing in that flat?

Oh, that's not cat fur, Mr. Wonka.
He's not after Maria, he's after her baby.
Take off your cap!
Because... you're dull, but honest.
You know, Melissa, this is not funny.
You imagine in a way that keeps her alive, because you want her to be alive.
What can we do better?
And by one, he means ten.
Up you come.
So, here we are.
Either they kill us or we kill them.
- No, I've got this.
No. I'm seeing some cracks there, crackerjack.
I don't look down on you.
How's the new partner?
Ok, you feel like a bogart. But in that photo, you look exactly like cotten.

The whole point of it was, she had repressed memories.
For now, I guess we don't have a choice.

The attack on this country isn't over.
You wouldn't wanna make that call for me if I treat you to a crab cake?
My baby's okay?
Thanks for pointing it out.
Baby, you gotta... you gotta fight. You gotta fight.
I asked you not to get involved.
The real problem is about to reveal itself.
Good play. Take five. - Come here.
The Shepherds that pulled me out of the tank, they kept asking me about it.
I have a girlfriend.
Yeah, much better.
Kennedy was pro-gun.
Why couldn't you just stay out of this?
It gets me into trouble, Mac.
What and you think Ferguson's just gonna stand there while you stick her with a needle?
I mean, that would be good, right?
-He can get us into the hotel.
And I have to see her and all the others like her every day.
Hey, hey, my friends aren't as nice as me.
Cora, nobody gets into this kind of stuff alone.
- Yes, I do.

TIJUANA, MEXICO INTERNATIONAL CHECK POINT USA/MEXICO
I barely remember.
Each one of them bets me that I can't streak down a hallway, jump five feet over a bunch of tacks that they'd laid down on the floor, grab the fire pole, slide down, and do it all in my tighty-whities.
I couldn't see what was there at the exhibition as a solid production that... that represented a professional life forever, you know?
Now, it's too late for Fred Kirby, but it's not too late for the rest.
Okay, so, you've done this before.
I fucked up your life.
I'm sorry, Pepe.
Dear God, man, do you even think before you shoot?
This is your only warning!
Mom, if we are gonna make a deal here, I need every bit of leverage available, which means you have to tell me the truth, for once.
It was an idiot move. I should have known better.
This is nothing.
Yeah, really hard.
"Who is this man who sits before me scared and real?
Where are you gonna get the money from?
That would be awesome.

No, I-I don't want-- You know what? I don't want to do it, 'cause if I die, I don't want to be strapped to you like an infant.
Tell me where she is first.
He told me he got his heart broken.
I'm... I'm getting too close to that fan!
That fire was intentionally set.
A bright guy, sort of the black sheep of the family because he didn't go into the drug trade.
No, I knew... how he felt about her.
I'll bet you that Stevie's on board.
- Yeah, no.
What about my immunity agreement?
That'd be awful, right?
And why would I do that?
Yeah, you able to narrow it down to one of the seven incoming dignitaries?

Christopher says everyone who testified against Gordon, under police protection.
You have to get him here.

They told me stories about Colin.
Well, don't bother setting foot inside this place until you find my briefcase.
Two in the back of the head.
Did my lips not move?
But these haven't been in regulation since 1996.
Is everything in place?
By the way, I encountered a friend of yours, yesterday in Paris.
It's not my fault your designs are last-minute.
And this one is a 72% match for the Indian rupee.
Now, the results came back from our DNA trawl of Lochnafoy citizens age 24 to 44.
We know who did it.
I wasn't trying to end it.
I asked him, "Ronnie, where you been?"
Oh, we can get this.
Actually... not at work anywhere.
How was your trip?
I am not known for being bold.
I didn't bring you anything.
Whoever kills him... gets paid double.

This is the only good news I've had this week.
- Josh Levine.
Serves him right if he's lying in a ditch somewhere.
I said for you to come alone.

Oh, well, in that case, you're gonna have to give me a pressie instead.
And I think someone did something to her.
Was it yours or Mr Kemp's idea?
I've been waiting.
Didn't make any friends.
And that adds up as leverage for the collaborators.
- Get out!
That is gonna be so great.
Well, whoever it was, they came prepared.
- Donna, whatever it is...
That's all we can do.
It's part of my plan to get in tight with Devon.
